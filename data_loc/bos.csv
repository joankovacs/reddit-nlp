TheCavis,"While our non-higher-ed %positive rate is still bad, our 5 day total positive case average might *just* stay under 5%. We were at ~40% higher ed tests before Thanksgiving week, ~20% higher ed tests during Thanksgiving week and we rebounded back up to ~40% yesterday. The next day to drop off will be 11/25, which was the day when higher ed tests started to decline. Since higher ed is negative, taking out a day with fewer and adding a day with more should keep the total %positive just a hair below Baker's red line as long as the non-higher ed doesn't spike even higher. 

That does show why I'm not a huge fan of the reliance on total %positive. Higher ed is a temporary population. We're going to hit a wall at the end of the semester again and these rates should increase. Today's data was just bad everywhere (Bristol, Essex and Worcester all reporting &gt;75 cases per 100k), but it looks better than last week because we threw in ~20k more higher ed tests to bring the top-line percentage down. The %positive in the general population (non-higher-ed) is a much better metric for determining what our status is and what our approach going forward should be.",boston

The short (updated) version is that your numerator is positives from new and repeat patients while your denominator is only new patients. That was fine for a long time (few people were tested, so almost every test was a new test anyway). The percentage of tests that were from new patients has steadily ticked down (75% over the summer, 60%ish for early fall, 50% in October) and then fell off a cliff this month to under a third of tests being repeat tests around Thanksgiving (even after I adjust for the higher education tests).

itsgreater9000,"&gt; Why is the number increasing if we are all doing exactly what we are suppose to be doing?MA has some the strictest rules in all of the US, why is the number increasing?

Because the chance of getting the virus and getting sick is _probabilistic_ in nature. During the summer there was less of a chance to get it, while now there is a higher chance of getting it. In both cases, the probability of getting it was shifted due to a variety of factors (weather, social distancing, strictness of mask wearing, how much time people spent together inside, etc...). I know you're looking for exact, specific, explainable events that have caused increases, but that isn't exactly how illnesses like this virus spread (obviously there are illnesses like norovirus, salmonella, etc. that are pretty specific, but this is not one of those viruses). 

Whether someone gets it relies on a joint probability of _many_ factors, and enumerating them is kind of pointless. Tell me, why do you think the regular flu has way more cases in the winter than in the summer? I've known people who got the flu in the summer - it's not impossible at all, it's just a matter of probability.",boston

We've discussed test delays previously in these threads and one of the things that's been suggested is that the testing companies are pooling samples. So, test 20 people together and, if the batch is negative, then they're all negative. If the pool comes back positive, put them back in the queue and test them all individually. 

It's possible that she got lumped into a batch of 20 people who were all negative, so she got the quickie all-clear while you got lumped into a batch with a positive, so you get the wait. At this short interval, the difference in your personal risk of being positive isn't really significant (the reported test %positive for tests taken on Sunday has gone from 4% among results reported prior to today up to 4.8% for results reported today), so there's no need for concern.

I'm talking about the damn-near-diabolical ""they'll fall in line once they can't travel or enter certain spaces."" That kind of rhetoric is worse than nothing if your goal is convincing people that taking the vaccine is worth the risk. 

&gt;  If you can't convince them that masks are safe to wear when they are made of cotton and paper

To be fair, this was NOT people's objection to masks at all. There are obviously some assholes here and there who either think the virus is fake or don't care at all about human life, but I think those people are probably in the minority. For the majority of people who half-ass mask compliance, I genuinely think they don't realize the basic facts that (1) It's very possible and not uncommon for you to be contagious with COVID-19 even though you feel great (2) You wear a mask so that in case you have asymptomatic COVID, you don't spread the virus to people who are at risk. Same situation for people who are concerned about vaccine safety. There are people who think the vaccine is the Mark of the Beast with a microchip in it, sure. But the majority of people aren't that.  

I don't think there's actually been a widespread effort to explain the facts to people that isn't polluted with a condescending tone.

So... they are ""extra staying home"" for 10 weeks now. No fun time visits to other households. No roomie Friday night parties. Now what? Do you think that could last 12-18 months till the vaccine is easily available? The answer isn't ""no""  - it's ""not even close."" 

After the initial 6 weeks (that's 3x as long as the ""2 weeks"" bullshit"" by the way), they should have opened everything, with masks mandatory only in public transit (yes, that's it, because that's the only place you might not be able to avoid prolonged (&gt;15mins), close range (&lt;6'

I can't comment on churches and how they are managing capacity...  but... again, these tents aren't spreading the virus, nor are restaurants. It's not a long-range alien virus.  This is suggested from:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html

Though I’m seeing plenty of cases with congestion/runny noses that only coincide with their symptomatic period. I’m writing in congestion and runny nose under the free-text “other symptoms” box in the state’s contact tracing system. (I do this under the supervision of a team of MDs who are making the call that yes, these are COVID symptoms.)

I think the issue is the symptom list is long and nonspecific. My official checklist includes fever, difficulty breathing/SOB, chest pain, muscle aches, cough, loss of appetite, loss of taste/smell, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and  “other symptoms” (congestion, runny nose, fatigue, COVID toes, dizziness, etc). All of these symptoms run the range of barely noticeable to severe. The most common symptom among healthier people in our dataset is loss of smell! Couple these symptoms with runaway community spread and it is going to be tough to only test those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath. You’d probably miss the majority of cases in with that strategy.

TheCavis,"New cases are the raw number of positive tests. Case rate is the percentage of tests that were positive. The number of tests vary by date, so the two could move independently, although they usually don't except in extreme cases like we're seeing right now due to the holiday. 

From a practical standpoint, the percent positive is mostly a QC metric. It tells you if you're testing enough. If you're only testing severely symptomatic people, for instance, almost all of your tests will be positive but you'll also be missing a lot of cases (basically what we saw back in April). As you add in mildly symptomatic and contacts of symptomatic people and contacts of the contacts, etc., you start pulling the percent positive down (less risky populations) even as the number of cases keeps increases (you catch the occasional case you would've missed). You want the positive to be below 5% to say that your positive test number is actually representative of what you see in the population and preferably below 3% to say your contact tracing is working well. 

Massachusetts' numbers are also a little weird because of the high number of colleges, which threw every swab they could find at students and staff. Almost half of our tests during the school year came from higher education, which were very negative as a whole (heavily tested and easily quarantined population), so they're split out as a separate line. When colleges stopped testing (like over the holiday), the total population %positive line spiked closer to the non-higher-ed population %positive line, which is always higher (less tested and harder to control population).",boston

It’s super safe, I go for walks alone all the time. My apartment now is prob best for 2 people or a couple, (currently paying 2k/month), there’s an older woman (very friendly and quiet) who lives upstairs alone and I always see her out for walks on her own too

I grew up in Roslindale so I know this area well, and feel compelled to share a warning against renting in West Roxbury. “Blue lives matter” types there. Less shitty now than it was 20 years ago but still a very white neighborhood. As a white woman I avoid that neighborhood as best as I can

somerwiz,"I'm not sure the drill press is the complete answer here.

You want a jig or fixture that can hold your piece firmly while you drill, and that might be the same regardless of whether you're using a handheld or a drill press.

It looks like the wood you want to drill is roughly the dimensions of a chunk of 2""x4"".

Imagine a 4"" cube of wood ( like from a 4""x4"" ).  Cut this in half at a 45 degree angle to form two wedges.  Place one wedge below your workpiece. and one above, and secure this.

Then, you drill straight down through the top wedge and your workpiece, stopping once your bit is into the bottom wedge.  A drill press may help a little, but a handheld will work too - and a drill press without a jig will still be painful.  This approach limits the wandering of the bit.

If I did it in my shop,  I'd table or chop saw the wedges, and then clamp them in place with a couple wood clamps or a vice, and have at it with the drill.

Alternatively, and depending on what type of drill bits you have, you may be able to work your way up - drill a small pilot hole ( like 3/16"" or so ), and the keep increasing the size of the bits - they'll want to follow the existing hold rather than wander off.",boston

I live next on a beach &amp; my dog is off leash 90% of the time. One of the reasons for this is I've found she is much more relaxed off leash. And so are other unleashed dogs, when they meet they sort things out by themselves pretty quickly without any problems.

But if one dog is on leash &amp; the owner pulls the leash tight that forces the dog into a defensive position and that's when things get nasty. Dogs on leash will relax as long as the owners are relaxed. If the leash is limp then the dogs will chill but as soon as a dog feels tension the dog will get it's hackles up and the other dog will have to respond to that. 

Think of it this way, you &amp; friend go to a new neighborhood and your friend is acting cool &amp; relaxed, the signal you're getting is that the folks here are okay.

The Mass Audubon Society has determined that the Fells is an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the Reservation provides essential habitat to breeding, wintering, and/or migrating birds. Thus, keeping dogs under control and leashed is important for the preservation of significant bird populations or communities. Similarly, allowing dogs to swim in Fells vernal pools and ponds is harmful to the habitats of a wide range of aquatic species. Spot Pond, the High Service and Winchester Reservoirs provide fresh drinking water resources to residents north of Boston.

If a driver pauses for a bike or pedestrian, we may lose that opportunity to safely get onto Main Street and then be either forced to wait forever for another opportunity (pissing off everyone behind us) or dangerously drive into traffic.

Invalid means that they couldn't detect RNase P, suggesting that either (a) the swab didn't actually pick up cells, (b) the RNA extraction failed or (c) the sample degraded severely in transit. If you don't detect COVID or RNase P, you repeat the test and/or extraction. If you get the same result, you assume there's no RNA and the test was invalid. 

(If you detect COVID but don't detect RNase P, that's still a positive, since you can pick up the virus without picking up cells, especially in an active infection.)

Inconclusive is different. It means that one of the two COVID markers they look for is above threshold, but not the other one. That's not something that should happen biologically, so there's either a false positive or a false negative. Repeat the test with fresh RNA if possible (to eliminate cross contamination).

I usually return to Boston yearly for 3 to 4 weeks but Covid-19 has made returning this year impossible as I would not be allowed to re-enter Thailand which has managed to successfully suppress Covid by closing it's borders, amongst other measures.

What currently stands out the most are the huge changes brought about by eliminating the elevated ""South-East Expressway"" and the near disappearance of the middle class and middle class housing.  The rollover of South Boston, Charlestown, Jamaica Plain and Somerville from working class to near million dollar upscale is shocking to me  Even such areas as Roslindale, Hyde Park and W. Roxbury, once the bastion of middle class Boston have become forbiddingly expensive  for any kind of traditional household. 
The impoverishment of low wage service workers who, in the 70s were at least able to sustain basic needs with what they earned is a singular disgrace.  

When I was in grade school, we'd be shown pictures of places like India with homeless people sleeping in the streets, emphasizing to us how lucky we were to live in America where everybody had a home.   How ironic and shameful it is that I see far fewer people sleeping on the sidewalks of Bangkok than I do in Copley Square.

The 70s were as racially divided and confrontational as any in my lifetime.  This was the decade of forced ""Busing"" to integrate schools and the volcanic hatred it engendered was frightening and disheartening.  It put little children in the crosshairs of violence and  was a tragic era of social engineering that Boston has yet to recover from, it's public school system to this day still in tatters.

However, neither is it solely in the hands of a at times incompetent, detached, corrupt, and even dangerous federal government. While I’m sure some local governments might abuse it, the scale of what they can do is far far less than what the abuses the federal government could carry out.

psychicsword,"I agree with a lot of what you are saying but I think the root of the problem goes deeper. There is a lack of trust and accountability with the police right now especially more so in some communities than others. The reason that we allow doctors and engineers to handle the find details of right in wrong within their licensed professions is because we know that the obvious cases will be solved outside of those institutions, often by the police, and we trust doctoring and we trust engineering as a whole even if we do sometimes distrust individuals. Without that trust and accountability it is hard to build these kinds of oversight systems into the very being of the system especially with the amount of political divide we are currently seeing.

&gt;Also, doctors are actually professionals. They had to go through college aiming for med school and come out with decent grades, test into med school, they have to continuously prove their skill and knowledge, their job demands continuing education, they're backed by and believe in tons of research.

This is where we began to disagree somewhat. When many of these professional licensing bodies were established medicine was not the same as it is today and many of those attributes were not assumed by the public. They may have been educated but they also may have been the snake oil salesman selling you a drug filled soda which did little to aid in your recover. The licensing bodies that we currently have for medicine were established in part as a direct response to the corruption and abuse that was rampant in the profession.

Additionally even in 2020 we are not just talking about doctors when looking at things like malpractice insurance and oversight committees. All levels of medical professionals are at risk of perpetrating medical abuse and are covered by a licensing body of some kind. It is not exclusive to the positions that require 8 years of higher education. When it comes to police, a 2017 national survey of 958 agencies, conducted by the University of California Fullerton and the Police Foundation, found that [87.4% of police had a 2 year education or higher with 35.6% having a bachelor's or graduate degree](https://www.policefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PF-Report-Policing-Around-the-Nation_10-2017_Final.pdf) While those numbers are not the same as in professions like practicing medicine, it isn't all that dissimilar to nursing where someone may have completed a 2 year degree and received a Associate Degree in Nursing but then continue their education as their careers continue to receive higher levels of salary and responsibility. This makes me believe that something like this is possible. 

Overall I think that it is important to take a step back from the political and fervour that exists in this debate so that we as a society can actually solve this problem. There won't ever be one bullet proof solution that just makes the problem go away and so we need to have an ongoing and healthy discussion to get us there. Until we can work to regain that trust and break down the Us vs Them attitudes we will never be able to make it.",boston

CoffeeContingencies,"There is some great behavioral science/psychology research on this topic already, in the broader sense.  It is a combination of intermittent reinforcement and a group contingency for reinforcement.  Intermittent reinforcement is when rewards are given randomly (sometimes never) to an individual as long as they have met certain criteria- in this case, taking the vaccine. Group contingencies are when an individual, multiple people or the whole group get a reward based on what an individual, multiple people or the whole group does. In this case, multiple people get the vaccine (maybe not the whole group) and one person gets the reward at random. 

The advantage of intermittent reinforcement is that it “keeps you on your toes” so to speak. You never know if you will get the reward or not and if so when you will.  The advantage of having it be tied to a group of people is the group gives peer pressure for others to do the behavior because it ups the odds of getting the rewards.

Giving rewards based on the number of people getting vaccinated (so like, a million dollars given to one random person for every million people vaccinated) would be the way to scientifically keep the vaccine momentum up.",boston

I understand that we need better leadership to provide messaging from the kinds of professionals who DO know and who are good at breaking things down in a way that laypeople can understand.

I also think we need to just do a better job in general of familiarizing the general public with how these processes work. How a clinical trial works. Who are the people involved. How does a vaccine (or any medication) get manufactured.

I feel like a lot of the skepticism stems from a sort of general dehumanization of the whole ""system"" as if it's robots out there manufacturing academic papers and drugs from thin air.

Cause I have friends at NIH who work on clinical trials. I used to work at a drug manufacturing factory. Both of my parents and my BIL work in chemical manufacturing.

I was demonstrating symptoms both times I took the test, but I’ve had allergies my whole life and was pretty sure that’s all It was. But with the state encouragement to get tested I figured I might as well take it. I don’t want to feel like I’m using up a valuable resource that could go to others...",boston

Mass testing was critical early, to prevent the virus from getting a foothold.

Summer was good for slowing transmission, but everyone knew it'd be sky high by now, like it is.

The virus had a foothold and is spreading rapidly, so the ""goalposts shift"" to minimize harm and casualties.  At this point, we need to lower the viral reproductive number.  You seem confused by the changing guidance and that's ok.

On-campus undergrads have free (required) testing twice a week with Covid pass, but off campus undergrads (me) are charged to get tested. Mostly I understand it because we don’t have access to campus so giving us Covid pass doesn’t make much sense, but also I would like to be able to get tested considering I pay the same tuition.

Other than the occasional water hammer, steam is great with a well maintained system. Drawbacks are relative to another system. Compared to hot water steam is less efficient but give you more humidity compared to hot water. The only guarantee with Steam and hot water are leaks. So just keep an eye out.

I did a quick scan of your profile to see if I could get a bit more background on you. 120-150k is pretty optimistic for your first job out of college (but who knows what it will be like in 6 years). It's doable, and your GPA/AP classes seem to indicate you're pretty smart, but it's gonna be 5% of new grad roles where you can expect that pay.

I've never looked at real estate in the area you're describing, but I'd bet its expensive. You could probably afford to live there on 120k/year, but youll be living like someone who makes far less than that.

Compared to NYC/Bay area, expect to make 10-15% less by virtue of being here instead for the same role at the same company. 

Lastly, if your goal is to move to boston after college, maybe look at some more schools in this area since they will have partnerships with local businesses. UMASS Amherst has a great reputation, and UMASS lowell has a great reputation for engineering. On the pricier side you can look at northeastern and WPI. If you have it in you, cant hurt to apply to harvard and MIT. If you want somewhere as a middle ground for cost, the colleges of the fenway have some good schools.

Most of the companies there are medium-big in size (mine is about 1,400). I love looking in buildings on the way to the T and seeing the cool biotech and engineering projects on video display that each company is working on. It is very expensive to live here so that sucks but with a 6 figure income you could definitely live quite well. Although expensive it’s still a bit cheaper than NYC housing.

This gap is why the state is rushing ""rapid tests"" to schools. They know there's a big problem they're not uncovering.

ApostateX,"And oxycontin has been given out without a prescription. But that's by people breaking the law, just like Gosnell did, only he killed actual babies and at least one woman. Doctors acting within the law do not perform abortions that are not medically necessary. There isn't a single state that allows late term abortion without medical cause.

But back to my original point. You made the claim that medically necessary abortions are not a point of dispute, nor are early term abortions. But that's not true. There is a vocal minority of anti-choice activists who are trying to make both those things illegal and are doing a ton of work at the state level to pass personhood amendments and abortion bans based on week of gestation or the cause of the pregnancy (consensual sex vs rape/incest.) These same activists have also been pushing laws making it harder for women to obtain abortions at any time, like TRAP laws, 24-hr waiting periods, mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds, defunding of local health care clinics, superfunding of crisis pregnancy centers which provide no medical at all, and so on. And then there are the highly vocal small number of crazies who picket abortion clinics, harass clinic workers and people seeking reproductive care, and who take even more extreme actions like bomb threats -- and actual bombs. And this is to say nothing of the judicial strategies employed by these people -- mostly Christian nationalists -- to seat religious extremists on appellate courts hoping to overturn precedent at the state and federal level.

You have, in your simple statement, disregarded 4 decades of violent anti-choice activism on two issues you claim are uncontroversial.

To your latest point, whether medically unnecessary late-term abortions should be permitted is actually not a highly controversial subject. There has been no major push from pro-choice advocates to legalize abortion up to birth for reasons other than medical necessity, either for the woman or the fetus. What you're calling disagreement is actually right-wing propaganda. Less than 1% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks -- so this is a tiny number of overall patients. When physicians and gynecologists DO encounter the rare woman who seeks an abortion after 24 weeks *without medical necessity -- a much tinier subset --* those are usually situations where there is domestic violence, the woman is depressed, the woman is on drugs, the woman is suddenly raising kids (or is pregnant) on her own, she tried to get abortion care earlier but because of other restrictions/cost she couldn't, or she is extremely young and had no idea she was pregnant. Those situations are largely handled through better social welfare programs and sex education, not hand-wringing about a non-issue.",boston

Strawman.

You don't like the conclusions of the very meta-analysis you posted so now you're shifting goalposts.

Onto the next link.

&gt;In 2010, at the end of the last influenza pandemic, there were six published randomised controlled trials with 4,147 participants focusing on the benefits of [different types of masks.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21735402/) 2 Two were done in healthcare workers and four in family or student clusters.  The face mask trials for influenza-like illness (ILI) reported poor compliance, rarely reported harms and revealed the pressing need for future trials.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the clear requirement to carry out further large, pragmatic trials a decade later, [only six had been published](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2): five in healthcare workers and one in pilgrims. 3 This recent crop of trials added 9,112 participants to the total randomised denominator of 13,259 and showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.   
&gt;  
&gt;The design of these twelve trials differed: viral circulation was usually variable; none had been conducted during a pandemic. Outcomes were defined and reported in seven different ways, making comparison difficult. **It is debatable whether any of these results could be applied to the transmission of SARs-CoV-2.**

And your WHO link is from June 2020.

Here's one from October 2020.

[https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks)

&gt;[**Why should people wear masks?**](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks#)  
&gt;  
&gt;Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission when worn by a person who is infected.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive **‘Do it all!’** approach including: physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, improving ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.",boston
marshmallowhug,"I'm in Somerville, but when we needed someone for shoveling our front sidewalk+steps, we generally paid $50-75. It is less than an hour of work. I would say that you should probably not accept less than $35/hr but $50-75 what I was generally paying.

We ended up hiring a service because of how many snowstorms happened while we were out of town last winter. That service charges us $90 for under 2"" and the charge increases from there. We put down a deposit back in September, I think, and they charge us 24hrs after each storm. They come out as many times as they are needed and put down salt as early as 5am, and they charge per storm and not per visit, so that's a luxury that we're justifying for now. I wouldn't pay as much for one snow shoveling.

For big storms, I think we tend to know there will be snow. We don't always know how much we'll get. We knew the Halloween storm this year was coming, but we thought the snow wouldn't even stick and then we ended up getting a few inches.",boston

ennnculertaGM,"It's the strawman you created - pretending like SARS-CoV-2 is some super-special ""this and that"" by dismissing that pre-COVID studies are most certainly relevant in understanding how it spreads and what can protect individuals. 

The meta-analysis I posted clearly stated that there is no evidence of strong protection - it is statistically insignificant, hence very small (perhaps non-existent in terms of general public use). These technical points are beyond most people, but I use this kind of analysis in my line of work and I get paid to provide an opinion. Moving on...

So sure masks may do a little bit (especially in indoor, health care settings) - but stop pretending like they are going to make any significant difference in the grand scheme of things in terms of cases or deaths. They do NOT have any significant effect, period. Nothing you think will change that. The WHO can recommend whatever desperate measures along with anyone else, but that still doesn't mean that masks make a significant difference. And stop pretending like ""dat no good person wid no mask on in da street is killin' people"" - that is such a gross exaggeration. 

""Do it all"" does not equal ""masks make a significant difference.""

Theyve changed how they set up the line since i went there a month or 2 ago... But in any event... You wait in line.... They confirm you have an appointment.... then they have you scan a QR code, which basically puts you in a Queue to go inside.... They pull 15-25-40 people at a time, which y you will get notified on your phone that you can actually enter the building, where you then socially distance as you go through the building to the 2nd floor where you wait in line still, and essentially its next person in line to the next open window..  They can do all transactions at ANY window... and if memory serves me right, they have like 30 windows open... But it moves slowly.... it took like 2 hours to go from the appointment time to the time we actually left the building... all for a 5-8 minute interaction at the window.  Once you are Finished, You go down another set of stairs, that Leads you directly outside...

Pro Tip.... If you have a Broken Foot, or some other Medical issue, talk to the guys up front....

The issue with rapid tests is they're inherently less sensitive than PCR. That means they can easily miss new and/or mild infections.

The only thing that's going to increase your likelihood of getting a positive on a rapid test is the time it takes for the infection to build.

Rapid tests are meant to be used to confirm suspected infections, not confirm the lack thereof. It's the same story with rapid flu tests. In an ideal world, they wouldn't be used *at all* for people not showing symptoms of a respiratory infection.

ennnculertaGM,"&gt;Are you saying that fomite transmission (contaminated objects) is the mechanism of transmission within households, 

No. People in households socialize (e.g. roommates hanging out, drinking, smoking, etc.). Maskless, too, and funny enough just about all if not all of the CDC studies about ""mask effectiveness"" are all about indoor-specific settings (and often with people who are sick, too).  That's direct, close range exposure to short-range droplets, which is the main way this thing spreads other than touching sick people directly. 


&gt;how do you explain the early choir clusters?

This is the ""special circumstance"" I mentioned in my previous reply. Further research in these settings could not rule out other methods of transmission. 

It's doomer fantasy to assume there is a high risk of spreading the virus this way. They have a handful of ""well documented"" instances of it... out of how many total instances? A billion? How many choirs, restaurant dining sessions, etc. have there been since March? Billions is probably about right.

Jason_OT,"&gt;So why are cases up but deaths pretty consistent. Did they come up with better therapies or is it just catching it early?

A big part of deaths not being up significantly (yet) is they're at such a low ""signal"" level, and at the low level there's also a lot of ""noise"" in the signal, making it harder to tell whether they've been increasing or not.

The last week or two it looks to be starting to get above that noise floor. Prior to then, it's fluctuated 5-30 fairly regularly going back to July. Average deaths per day had been ~15 for those 4 months or so. You can still see a bit of it in Sept/early Oct on the graphs here, and that it's started heading toward 20 since 10/12.

Add in lag from infection/hospitalization, plus the possibly lowered IFR from infected cohorts trending younger and treatment improving, and it's taking just a little bit more for that number to be clearly above the noise.

If you look at the long view graphs, you can see there's an inflection point of new positive tests on 9/22. That's when positive tests started ramping up. Deaths looking to have an inflection point starting 10/12 tracks with a 3 week lead to start seeing the first deaths from the increase of infections.

&gt;and less hospitalizations comparatively

This isn't really the case. You need to remember in the first wave most people who were likely infected couldn't even get tested. We were rationing tests to only those at high risk and/or with severe symptoms, and still having positive rates of 20-25%. Positive rates that high means we were still missing some of the cohort we wanted to capture, and comparatively it was a small cohort.

It touches on a good point, though. Hospitalizations are the best metric we have to compare then and now, even if the ratio of hospitalizations to true infections gone down a bit. If the ratio hasn't significantly changed since then, we can say true infections then were ~5x greater than the positives. If the ratio has changed, likely improved because of earlier testing and better treatment, then we can still say the true risk then was ~5x what it is now.

To make that point about risk more clear, imagine a fantasy world with an OTC treatment so good it was ""just like the flu"" (to be clear *it's not*), or imagine a world where a mutation of the virus made the effects less severe. In those worlds, the hospitalization to infection ratio would be much lower, and we wouldn't even need to worry about masks, social distancing, capacity limits, etc. Infection in and of itself isn't the problem, it's what the infections cause that are the problem.

In either case, we're currently about where we were mid-March. *Hopefully* that doesn't mean runaway growth and swamped hospitals in a month. *Hopefully* people's awareness and existing measures mean the growth rate is never that great, and we never come close to the same peaks again.",boston

ennnculertaGM,"&gt;diners are likely contributing to higher rates of transmission because they're probably talking to others at the table (known to increase output of respiratory droplets) and are in low-ventilation, air-exchange &lt; 3x hour indoor rooms for longer than 30 min. at a time. 

The alternative is they talk to the same people in their home. No one is avoiding socializing for 1-2 months, let alone 18, which is where this is headed. 

And while they are ""contributing"" to the spread it does not mean they are a large proportion of it.

&gt;Respiratory droplets are the primary cause of transmission. Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

Respiratory droplets are short-range and highly directional (talking loudly, yelling, coughing, sneezing directly at someone). Even if you looked right at your server when you placed your order and started talking (vs. while looking at the menu, as many people do), you're probably not going to hit him in the face with saliva (they're often above you, your saliva has to work against gravity), and even if you did, you'd have to be perfect-timing the worst time to dine out, which is shortly before you become symptomatic (you think you're fine, but you'll become ill soon)... but that's assuming you are even sick, and Fauci said that ~0.8%? (and many of these people are symptomatic, so this are unrealistic worst case odds of someone being ill when they dine out) of the population is infected at any given point in time. Pretty slim odds here of anything bad happening. You're basically worrying about ""that one guy who had his first COVID-sneeze while out in public."" Going too far for too little here. 

Also, touching sick people directly is bundled with respiratory droplets. That's probably even higher risk, especially intimate touching (read: kissing, household activities w/ family where you touch someone's face, etc.) 


&gt;Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

These are one-off instances. There have been literally countless *possible* instances of transmission like this around the world, yet only a few documented instances of transmission. Also, singing and talking loud is night and day. 

&gt;Eating at a restaurant for dine-in is an optional activity. Ideally, people would takeout and tip generously for staff risking their safety. Although, I agree it would be better PPE practice if K/N95s were provided to staff/high risk grocery workers.

Your concern is valid as it seems you've followed exactly what the health organizations have both directly told you, and both CDC and WHO recommendations for when to see others, but as many orgs have pointed out, people do test positive well after they're contagious. I so appreciate you following the rules around getting tested before coming here, but more than likely whether you test positive or not, as long as you've been symptom free for two weeks you're among the least likely to be actively spreading covid as you now have antibodies that prevent renfection for a couple months.

When my cousins spent the summer with us my mom would pick them up at the airport and drive them the long way through Boston to our house while pointing out different places.  The 6+ of us would spend our time at the Science Museum and the MFA. We also loved going to the JFK Museum that had kid friendly performances every month that were awesome (puppet shows, storytellers, musicians, book authors).  We would tour the USS Constitution, walk in the Boston Commons and visit the Isabella Gardner Museum.  I did learn a lot of history but as I grew up to show my own friends around I would learn more and it's always fascinating. (I just learned today who Faneuil Hall was named after and that a group is trying to change the name! A few years back I joined a halloween tour and learned a bunch about the dead buried everywhere) 

I also danced in the Boston Ballet growing up.  My mom drove me up to 4 times a week into Boston and I danced at the Wang Theater in many performances. We even had a dance for the opening of the Zakim Bridge which I vividly remember because our ""cars"" crashed at the end of the dance haha.

kristahdiggs,"Mainly what I am upset about, regarding Baker, is the incessant goalpost shifting. At the beginning of the summer, he and the DESE refused to give guidance to schoold districts about re-opening. They told districts in July to make three plans (fully open, hybrid, and remote obly) and to submit those plans. All districts did this, and then very quickly (within days) had to have SChool Committees choose a path for their district. Different SC made different choices. 

Then the DESE came out with a “map” (what everyone sees now, the color-coded mal by town) for what districts should do. Keep in mind this map was released after districts had made the decision of what to do. Red was fully remote, yellow was hybrid or remote, and green was fully open or hybrid. They said all districts should follow that map and if your school district community went red, shift to remote learning (or vice versa for other colors, etc). About 70% of districts in MA went hybrid or fully remote at this point. 

Then when the numbers started going up, they changed the guidance. Now you had to be red for THREE weeks to go remote. 

Then they changed the guidance again and said that red didn’t mean you should go remote at all. This was about two weeks ago, as numbers were skyrocketing and communities were jumping into the red left and right. 

Now they threw away that map because it looks bad (120 red communities) and made all those communities yellow. And everyone should be in school, deapite the fact that the highest case rates are in the population of school aged children. Now DESE (and very foolish people online) are saying that students are getting the virus because they aren’t in school... except most kids ARE in school AND when they weren’t in school (April through Sept), children numbers were VERY low. 

So to me, its the data manipulation, the lies, the goal post shifting, and the very very bad “science” they are using.",boston

But if the initial vet visit sees ANYTHING remotely close to a symptom, insurance won't cover it, forever, as pre-existing.  And unless they pay to cover something, you don't get any value for the premiums.

Regardless of whether you go through with the insurance, I’d also recommend that you apply for a CareCredit card preemptively.

TheCavis,"The 1584 is the 7 day average of based on when the tests were reported. The ""New Cases Per Day"" graph is a 7 day average based on when the tests were taken. There's going to be a small offset there.

There's also the issue where it'll take a little while for the tests taken to be reported, so you'll typically cut off the last few days in making the charts that rely on ""swab taken"" dates. The last seven actual days are 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604, 1205, 377 and 4. You can see that's pretty useless for a seven day average, since you've got a couple days that are just too soon for tests to be returned. Even that 1205 will probably jump a bit.

So, instead, you cut off the last three or so days and end up with 1133, 871, 518 followed by the same 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604 for the ~1400 average on the graph. Since our trajectory is upward and there were a couple of weird days around Halloween where we dropped below 1k, every day we'll see more cases reported, but we'll have to wait a bit for the ""new cases per day"" graph to catch up. 

Also, expect a big jump in a few days in that line when those two Halloween days drop out and the 1205, 377 and 4 get filled in with reported tests. It's one of those things that will be dramatic looking, but it's the same old scary trend catching up in the graphs rather than a new scary trend.",boston

Yes, but why?

[This study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408) (amongst others, I believe) suggested that other folks stayed home more during the BLM protests.

Moral righteousness isn't magic. Masking and the fact that the protests occurred outdoors during the summer may have helped, but changes in behavior of non-protestors (staying home) probably also contributed. If there is widespread celebration without good social distancing practices, we will all suffer the consequences.

I don't know about middle and high school students, but I am looking at the elementary school kids (neighbors and friends) - they all go to extra curricular activities. Some even get sent to a ""daycare"" for their remote hybrid days, as both parents have to work. If we assume that there's a  risk of transmission anywhere, wouldn't it be better for kids to just go to school and nowhere else? At least spread would be somewhat localized, versus it getting spread all over the place? 

So by keeping schools hybrid we are effectively trading kids going to the same place every day with the same group of peoe for kids going to different places every day with different people. I understand the teachers position fully, especially ones who are in a risk group, but I honestly don't know whether keeping schools hybrid vs in person would make that huge of a difference from perspective of virus spread in the larger community.",boston

For me, it was that USCIS had failed to update my address in their system, even though I had proof that I had submitted it, so they were repeatedly sending biometric appointment notices to my old address in a different state, and for the local office there. Then whenever I called them, they would tell me that I needed a “Level 2” person, but there was never one available. This went on for four months, then I contacted Elizabeth Warren’s office a few days before Christmas last year, and voila - had my biometrics appointment in Revere during the first week of January. 

It was the woman who lived directly underneath me. Luckily I already knew her because it was such a small building, but the apartment below hers was empty, so if it had gone there I would never have known!

In reality, there’s a higher likelihood that child abuse and neglect have persisted or increased during the pandemic, Lindauer says. But without access to the customary channels of communication—such as schools and doctor’s offices—these cases have largely gone unreported.""*

*“What the data shows is that many child abuse and neglect reports come in through school; teachers, paraprofessionals, and nurses are mandated reporters,” says Lindauer, who is an associate clinical professor of law at Northeastern. “In a non-pandemic world, [if] kids come in with a bruise, or they haven’t been fed or bathed, or they have consistent injuries or pain, that potentially could be reported to a child welfare agency.”*",boston

rdtm32,"I am not familiar with any well-grounded form of public policy, health or otherwise, that considers pragmatism to be anything other than achieving the greatest tangible effect at the smallest degree of intervention.

We have very high mask adherence in MA. We will never reach 100% nor reach 0% human error. We don't disagree about that. We also seem to agree that the vast majority of transitory outdoor situations, mask or no mask, are of virtually zero epidemiological relevance.

This precondition sets the stage for the newly expanded mask mandate to be - *at best* - a vanishing degree of marginal benefit in pursuit of Nth-degree micro-management.

Your justification that it will lead to a little improvement at the margins bakes in several assumptions: that the relatively obscure hypothetical you're plucking from one end of the behavioral distribution long tail occurs at any type of frequency that impacts transmission; that the behavioral outliers on the other side that you're failing to at all consider won't become stronger negative contributors to pandemic control (e.g. the person who normally complies with indoor mask usage now goes ""fuck all of it""); that the expansion of this mandate bears no pandemic-related deadweight cost unrelated to the mask vs. no mask question (e.g. population burnout/tiredness at being micromanaged diminishes adherence to other guidance; newfound ubiquity of masks leads to cavalier attitudes about other, more important practices like sustained distancing); and that the expansion of this mandate bears no broader deadweight cost (e.g. bad enforcement actors abuse this newfound power; health-incentivizing behavior like outdoor exercise becomes disincentivized).

None of the things I listed are about ""it won't achieve perfection so it's bad"". All of them are about ""we need to think broadly about marginal returns and unintended consequences to be sure we're acting sensibly"". This is what public policy is supposed to look like, not ""nuance is useless, control us harder daddy"".",boston

this is the ballot question in Florida. MA voted on similar lines for a minimum wage increase, only we will reach ours faster because we voted on it in 2018. 

&gt; Last election they voted to give felons voting rights (again something 90% of the privileged Boston eggheads would cringe at)

according to the timeline of voting rights in MA written by the [Emancipation Initiative](https://emancipationinitiative.org/ballots-over-bars/returning-the-right-to-vote/), previously incarcerated individuals in Massachusetts have never been denied the right to vote. for about 30 years, people currently serving time had the right to vote by absentee ballot; this change was passed in 2001. 

&gt; In fact college educated white men and women (aka all of boston) broke trump nationwide.

two flaws here: the NYT has white college graduates at 49 - 49, and acknowledge that they do not account nearly enough for mail in ballots, who were more likely to be that demographic. white college graduates voting for Biden especially increased *in* key swing states, primarily MI, MN, and PA. moreover ""all of Boston"" clearly doesn't line up with your statement, given that Boston, Cambridge, and MA more widely all heavily vote Democrat. if the demographic of specifically Boston voters, and more broadly college educated white voters, was overwhelmingly Trump, why would the state with the highest proportion of those voters vote overwhelmingly Dem?

It means people have less money to put towards small businesses in the area.

srhlzbth731,"That's a lot of questions, and I'd highly recommend checking out some of the sidebar info, old threads where people ask about living here, and googling.

That being said, from my perspective as a mid-20s professional, I think Boston checks most of your boxes. I have time, so here's some info:

* There is a lot to do. I hike quite a bit, am on a local sports team, and during non-covid times visit museums a lot and have a yearly subscription to Boston in Broadway shows. There's a solid music scene, lots of breweries, good food, and good shopping.
* The economy is solid. I work in software, and my mid 20s friends have all settled in well to the city in white-collar jobs. I have less knowledge on the blue-collar side of the economy, but the Boston area has always had a large population of blue collar workers.
* Boston is pretty expensive. If you want a bit of land and some more space, you'll likely not be able to rent in the downtown area. There are a lot of nice areas within 30 minutes of the city though if you're willing to be a bit further out. I'd explore zillow to get the best idea of what you can get with your money.
* Yeah, the age is pretty mixed. Lots of college kids, tons of mid-20s professionals, and a good number of older people still living in the city. There is quite a bit of diversity, but Boston is a more historically segregated city, so you'll find neighborhoods that are mostly white or mostly hispanic/portugese etc. rather than the whole city being a huge mixing pot of people. There are a lot of churches because this is an old city, but the population itself isn't particularly religious.
* The city is pretty dog friendly. You see lots of people in downtown with dogs, and there wouldn't be an issue bringing a service dog into stores or restaurants. If the service dog is certified, you shoudn't have issues with housing. A good friend of mine has a 24/7 service dog who is always downtown with them.
* Boston is a somewhat smaller and historical city, so the atmosphere is quite different than Chicago or LA. There's a distinct financial district, historic Italian neighborhood (North End) and many distinct parts of the city. It's nice to have a car for day trips out of the city and convenience, but it's a very walking-friendly city. My SO has a car, but in my 7 years here I never personally have.
* The winter is kind of grey and sucks a little, but imho it's worth it for the rest of the year here. And there's easy access to skiing/snowboarding if you're interested.",boston

oneMadRssn,"I think 20 cops is plenty. The goal is not to catch all non-maskers, but to make it known generally that enforcement is occurring. That will be enough to significantly increase compliance.

Most people only need to witness someone getting fined / kicked off once for it to make a lasting impression, at least for a month. So we only need there to be enough for most people to witness someone getting fined or kicked off once every month or so.

I think you put the cops in pairs, so people are less likely to get aggressive with them. Put one pair per subway line - that's 10 cops if you count silver line, and then divide the bus routes into 5 approximal even zones. Have the cops constantly riding, changing trains or buses at every stop, 7 days a week. At that rate, you're fairly likely to bump into a cop at least once a month.",boston

Nomahs_Bettah,"no, I'm pointing out that I think all Democratic leaning states (whether they have the outward image of being very left, like CA, or ""fake liberal,"" like MA, among progressive voters) are *much* less overall progressive than we originally thought. 

each state has some things that are more liberal than others. that's not ""ignoring our own flaws,"" it's being realistic about what a ""real vs. fake"" progressive state looks like. MA has much stricter gun laws when compared to Vermont, which still maintains constitutional carry (you don't need a permit to carry a gun, open or concealed). California had much more difficulty legalizing gay marriage than VT or MA, but now has much stronger protections regarding civil and human for transgender individuals than either state, including being the first and only state to ban trans and gay ""panic defenses."" 

MA in some instances looks more progressive than it actually is (weed laws). in some instances, CA looks more progressive than it actually is (ballot questions, as mentioned above). in some cases, VT looks more progressive than it actually is (gun laws). liberal and progressive platforms are nuanced and cover a lot of different aspects and areas of law, and I think we should be more careful in our assessment of the political leanings of states we perceive as more liberal than ours because of it. 

moreover, I never stated that Massachusetts had no flaws, only that the ballot questions were relevant in addressing flaws in MA. you haven't listed any specific policy from Vermont or California that you would like to see enacted here aside from the accessibility of legal weed, and I agree that it should be more easily available. what else would you like to see? is it possible that in some ways, California is a more liberal state, and in others, Massachusetts is?",boston

It's also important to note that pandemics don't stop at state borders. We can do all we want, but as long as the country does badly, we will still be very much affected.

Fucking_Sarcastic,"Liberty is not choosing to spread illness to others. That’s something completely different. Just like Liberty isn’t being able to rape or murder or kill. Liberty is the preservation of freedom for the individual. You wanna be free though, you gotta make sacrifices. 

I don’t get it. These anti-mask motherfuckers will tout how much they support *their* country by going and fighting in a foreign war, but when the war is on their soil suddenly a modicum of fighting is taking away their liberty. They will put on a military uniform because the government tells them to, but a mask is taking away their liberty. They’ll brand themselves with Hawaiian shirts, and militia gear, they’ll organize into cells, all in the name of liberty. 

But they won’t put a tiny piece of cloth over their face. 

A mask isn’t a Nazi uniform. It isn’t a muzzle. It doesn’t identify you as weak or as a supporter of big government. A mask keeps the government from fucking with you. It’s the fucking m16 of the war on this virus. 

So fuck the argument that masks remove liberty. Not wearing a mask isn’t liberty. It’s a selfish tantrum by a small-minded individual who chooses to ignore science, because they don’t actually like to do things for the greater good unless there is some sort of prestige or reward attached.

pillbinge,"Calling it ""Kendi-esque"" is ignoring that Kendi is only stating what educational research has established for decades. It's not unique to him. I'm also a huge critic of his book and supporter of not reading it so trying to find some way to lump us together makes no sense. You're aiming for something that isn't there.

Higher ed. isn't left-thinking. It's (neo)liberal. Don't conflate the two. Higher education wants everything at the same time and has no means of getting it. The people who work in the field, especially at the collegiate level, are absolutely obnoxious and stand for nothing. They're so used to playing victim that they don't know how to take a stance in materialism (e.g. get results, keep them, and say that maybe this is our reality). You don't need to explain that to me and if you need a third person to tell someone else so that's basically why I have this account.

bkk-bos,"I wanted to have my dates correct when I composed that post so naturally I went to Wiki and was surprised how little information was there...mostly just cross-references to successor agencies.  
My personal knowledge relies on a ageing brain, an often unreliable and anecdotal date-base.  I grew up in the Reading, Melrose, Malden area so the MDC was always in the background of our lives then, controlling the many parkways and wooded reservations in that vicinity.
It's difficult to understate the all encompassing influence the MDC had on the eastern half of the state, post WW2.
They controlled the entirety of the water supply network and all public lands.   Most of the major roadways leading into Boston were controlled by the MDC as well.  Because it's leadership positions were all appointed with no term limit, it was not in any way accountable to the electorate.  
It's important to understand that in the era up to the 80s, the Massachusetts Governor was  very weak.  He was answerable to the ""Governor's Council"" a holdover from Colonial days and the President of the Senate actually had more practical power. It was notable that during the 80s and 90s, that senate president was non-other than William ""Billy"" Bulger, younger brother of the infamous gangster and serial murderer James ""Whitey"" Bulger. He went on to become president of U-Mass/Boston.

I would suggest you start your research into the MDC by focusing on the planning and development of the Quabbin Reservoir which was probably the MDCs signature project.  From that research, a lot of ancillary information should become apparent.
I can be of little direct help as I now reside in Bangkok, Thailand but I wish you well in your ambition to make access to public lands available to all and not just special interests.",boston

Tragically, it stands to reason that the cost of implementing this at all schools is far outweighed by the costs of not, yet we still find ourselves in this terrible place.

RainTraffic,"I agree with you here, and I also think there is some moral conflation happening in this thread more broadly. There are two separate issues that are being seen as one --teenage drinking and teenage drinking during COVID. Should anyone be hanging out in big groups drinking beer right now during a global pandemic? I hope we can all agree that for public health, the answer to that question is no. And holy hell, do I miss drinking with friends.

That said, America has a higher legal drinking age, by several years, than other similarly-developed countries. I am not sure if I'm shocked about the sentiment around teenage drinking tending to be a little more conservative (some might use the term ""puritanical,"" however incorrectly), but I also recognize that this condemnation seems to be an American thing. Teens drinking? Let me clutch my pearls. This might not be as big of a deal in a place like Europe.

(Again, I agree that nobody should be should be hanging out in a group drinking beer in someone's basement during a pandemic. Separate issue.)

I also don't have teenagers, don't ever want to, and therefore have no stake in the claim of whether I would want ""my kids"" drinking at someone's house. I don't want kids, period. But maybe, just maybe, if we didn't make such a huge deal about alcohol, the mystique would be a little less influential on teens looking to have a good time. But then again, I don't know.",boston

* Watched live-streamed concerts of my favorite artists (even better when it's FB/IG live since it has a more interactive feel)
* Hopped on the baking band-wagon (it's time-consuming and delicious)
* Re-connected with friends who don't live in Boston (we set up a recurring day/time to hang-out which has helped us stay in touch more easily than one-off chats)
* Went back to the gym a few times for socially-distanced workout classes
* Ordered take-out from restaurants I haven't tried before (Boston isn't as much as a ""foodie"" city as some other places I've been but there are some good restaurants if you really look!)

roosterleft,"My NEXT theory is that “household transmission and social gatherings” is a shorthand to explain the VERY high number from “close contacts” for HH clusters. Right now, a HH cluster averages over 18 new cases. Impossible because households aren’t that big, right? I think the key is in the “close contacts” for households. They wouldn’t be household members, and maybe it’s not a party or work (as I’d think those would get put under social gathering/work/etc by definition), but they are seeing others casually who they’re infecting. 18 is the 3rd highest cases per cluster, after corrections and hospitals. So whatever you want to call non-party close contacts, that is a really high driver. And maybe he called that social gatherings, when by definition that’s something else.

QuinZ33,"&gt; With 1% of the population having got Covid 

This is wildly inaccurate.

We've had roughly 10,000 deaths, and there's roughly a 0.5% infection fatality rate, so that imputes about 2 million cases. There are roughly 7 million Massachusetts residents. So roughly 28.5% of the population has had it.

Since the exact numbers are unknown (deaths are a little uncertain, IFR is a lot uncertain), it could plausibly be anywhere from 10% to maybe 40% of the population.

There's no chance whatsoever that there have only been 70k cases (which would be 1% of 7 million). We've had twice that many positive tests, even though the majority of our cases happened when testing was nonexistent.

Scrap exam schools all together and return schools to their communities for starters. The idea of ""competitive schools"" doesn't make sense. Education isn't a net zero gain.

&gt;Keeping in mind that these schools graduate students who frequently go on to academically demanding colleges.

Right now there's no free college, especially these ones even if they offer financial aid. There's no reason we should feel obligated to send students to college. The only reason that's happened is because other options have been taken away and sent abroad.

We also don't then see the benefits of their education while they drown in debt. The best researchers end up working for private companies. I don't know a single Ph. D working for the government. That's a far cry from decades and decades ago where the government was at the helm of research and basically still is with funding (like how pharmaceutical companies do only a tiny bit of research at the end for their drugs).

The very idea that we're feeding kids into the college system is what makes college even worse. If colleges want the integrity then they should be educating students well enough on their own. It's not our prerogative to make sure kids are ready for an ultimately privatized system.

&gt;It's ""wont to do.""

It's autocorrect. Don't grasp too hard.

&gt;What if the opinion is that this person hasn't shown either the preparation or aptitude necessary to handle Calculus II? Is that racist?

Nope! Someone's either ready or not. But we can also look at scores in the aggregate and see who's ready or not and it does reveal fault lines along demographic lines.

And again, I would say side note: don't even bother with Calculus in high school anyway. People only ever use Algebra and Geometry in their life and never use calculus. Nationalize colleges and teach it there, or in a sort of gymnasium-style system like in Germany.

Honestly, I want to take care of this now because there are some really bad numbers out there, especially in places where you see fewer college students pulling it down. Lawrence had 380 cases last week on 5283 tests.  

It's great that Amherst, Cambridge and Wellesley had sub-0.2% positive rates while having more than one test per five official residents, but Lawrence had a 7.2% positive rate and one test for every ~17 people, so hopefully this week's report will result in flooding it (and all the higher percent areas) with tests.

1maco,"Unless you mean multi member districts there isn’t a redistricting  solution.

As it goes now outside of Boston you get a combination of regions not big enough for a full congressional district and the bigger one wins. Like the 2nd district is Greater Worcester, the eastern Pioneer Valley and parts of Suburban Boston. Greater Worcester is the largest individual faction so that’s where the Rep is from. In MA-01 Springfield is larger than the Berkshires/Pioneer Valley so their guy wins. 

In MA-06 it’s the urban North Shore beats out the Merrimack Valley/Suburban North Shore areas. So Moulton/Tierney are from the southern tip of the district. 

MA-03 Lowell beats out metrowest and Lawrence. Each of the top 3 finishers represented a region of the district. 

MA-04 went the way it went because of the South Coast beat the metrowest areas. 

There are just obvious areas of the state that FPTP obviously benifits.

And considering which parts of the state tend to get somewhat disenfranchised (geographically dispersed suburbs) and which disproportionately benifit (Working class gateway cities) I could see the outcomes looking pretty much like Markey/Kennedy

People who oppose you aren’t just dumb. They want the system that helps them. Duh. And for Lowell or Springfield keeping the current system preserves their political clout.

itsgreater9000,"&gt; Unless you mean multi member districts there isn’t a redistricting solution.

There are a variety of ways to fix it, multi-member districts works. I was thinking more along the lines of defining entirely new districts around [communities of interest](https://ballotpedia.org/Community_of_interest), but there are many solutions where redistricting _does_ in fact help people get better representation. I am sure we both agree that what we are trying to maximize here is how representative the elected officials are of the electorate.

Almost every example you gave is further proof that the elected officials aren't really representative of the communities they are supposedly serving, which is just not the point of democracy. I want to vote for someone that will represent my interests and understands my community. Choosing RCV will allow me to do that in a way that doesn't have me casting a vote for a Dem in every single election where I would be better represented by someone else.

&gt; People who oppose you aren’t just dumb. They want the system that helps them.

And short sighted thinking has, since the beginning of time, never helped anyone in the long run. Saying ""yes"" to RCV will enable more third parties (or new ideas) to get their way into the race (either by thought share, or by actually beating candidates that aren't very competitive). In the long run, this will produce more representative congressman in both local and state-level offices.

Every Thursday for the past 28 weeks, this rally has taken place in the center of Swampscott—and only a block away from our town’s oldest elementary school, Hadley.

Our in-person high needs students at Hadley have had to hear and see this disgusting display of hate every Thursday. Tomorrow, a larger share of Hadley students will return to their school as their cohort begins hybrid learning. It will be the first time in 230 days they have been in their school building. The Back the Blue rally will start after their school day has begun, and is scheduled to conclude at dismissal ~12pm.

Since Greater Lowell is the largest single constituency of the 3rd district (former 5th) they get a representative despite not being the majority of the district.

TheCavis,"&gt; The weekly data doesn't show a huge spike in any of these communities, they mostly seem to be in places North of the city like Waltham and Lawrence.

We're a couple days from town specific weekly data, but JHU's data is broken out by county daily. (It's included in the PDFs, but only started in the raw data archive in August, so I stayed with JHU's figures.)

These are the [most relevant counties, 7 day rolling average, cases per 100k](https://i.imgur.com/B0FZWA4.png). Essex is definitely high, but we know a lot of that is [Lawrence](https://www.cityoflawrence.com/796/Lawrence-COVID-19-Case-Count) since we're looking at 60-100 daily cases from there right now and ~120 total from Essex. The other two that stick out to me are Suffolk County and Bristol County both surging. The southern feed doesn't reach Bristol, though it catches Stoughton (which borders Bristol County). We'll have to see where in Suffolk the spike is coming from, but the spike in Bristol (with a lesser spike in Middlesex and an Essex spike that's due to a more distant Lawrence) makes me wonder if it is concentrated further south. 

That adds another thing to look at in the weekly, though. I've been playing around with choropleths of Massachusetts. If there's a surge down there and there aren't any STS sites, I'm curious if we'll see test %positive spike past 3-5%.

Their ganache is very dense and rich. One slice knocks out my appetite for hours. You can test the waters by trying out one of their cupcakes with the chocolate frosting on top: it’s the same ganache. They have stores in Arlington, Belmont, and Wellesley, so not quite as convenient as Flour. 

I haven’t been too impressed with Flour’s chocolate cakes, but their other flavors have been great. Notably the carrot cake...",boston

AreYouNobody_Too,"A better idea would the the 18 year term limits for justices on a rotating ""retirement"" schedule.  Gives every president an appointment or two.  When a justice retires from SCOTUS, they get moved back down to the lower courts to finish their lifetime appointments as Senior Justices.

From there, they have a few options:

1. They can work as a true senior justice - basically backfill as a part timer.  They take cases where someone recuses, retires, gets appointed elsewhere, etc. until they decide to fully retire.
2. They resume work as a full time justice.  If there aren't any seats open on the court, you automatically open one for them.  When they full retire from the court, that seat is then open for appointment as normal.  This keeps what are supposed to be our top legal scholars in the system as long as possible, then expands the court in a non-partisan way which has been begged for by the judicial branch for at least a decade now.

In either option above, the ""retired"" SCOTUS justice can also return to SCOTUS to fill in when there is a recusal or other imposition that prevents a sitting justice from hearing a case (illness, retirement, death, or other circumstance that leaves a vacancy).  9 justices at all times, no panic buttons need to be pressed on filling that seat.  If it's a long term vacancy, you just leave that justice in the seat until the next appointment comes up in a few years tops.

Before you take consensus of ""public health experts"" to heart, you should review the very evidence they SHOULD be using (like that which Heneghan) provided to come to the conclusions they come to.  It's usually written plain English. Bonus if you are good with data analysis or ANOVA/statistics.

- the white plastic is not color matched.

- the exterior drains over the color making them appear dirty quickly.  
- the doors should shut faster. 
- plastic seats are better than cloth nastiness but they should be more comfortable and retraction should work better. 
- stops and starts are jerky and the vibration and noise is more intense than the old trains. It’s probably a lighter an more powerful train but they could have designed to match the old performance. 

The concerns are more atheistic but elude to an inferior product. 

For a backdoor to come to light we probably would already be on rocky terms with the Chinese. 

My concerns are:

1. A backdoor causing a denial of service and hindering evacuation or alt something less extreme. This is a worry regardless of origin but tensions with China and gov involvement make it relevant. 

2. I assume they were the low bidder by a decent margin. I’ve looked at high end windows - Chinese were 15k, polish were 30k, and American were 45k.  I also understand their are specs/requirements. While Chinese products can be great, it seems like more often corners are cut. A great train is more than just weight and power. It’s ride noise, ride vibrations, ambiance, drainage. It’s intelligent design coupled with quality metals, plastics, glues, breaks, suspension, motors, motor controllers, electronics, software, glass, paint, etc. Anticipating and preventing issues is a huge and expensive process. The mbta might have specs but if they’re not asking the right questions, it doesn’t matter.

duckbigtrain,"Other health experts would say this:

Here’s the actual story:

Before COVID-19, according to the evidence, people with symptoms and people who work closely with them (e.g. doctors, nurses) should wear masks. If you aren’t in those categories, wearing a mask is useless-to-slightly-bad. Interestingly this is more or less what many Asian countries have been doing since SARS-1.

If you recall, in the early days of COVID-19, that’s what the WHO, CDC, Fauci, etc told us to do, based on the reasonable assumption that COVID-19 would be similar to other respiratory viruses. Some countries, however, told everyone to wear masks.

Then scientists started observing that countries with strong masking cultures/mandates were doing much better than countries without. It was very striking. At the same time, evidence was emerging that COVID-19 transmission happens a lot _before_ symptoms. This is around when the mask messaging rightly became very much pro-mask, regardless of symptoms.

COVID-19’s high presymptomatic transmission is actually somewhat unusual for respiratory viruses, which explains why masking works more for COVID, but it’s also not some crazy weird hard-to-believe mask-specific mutation.",boston

Nomahs_Bettah,"I'm not saying information is ""hidden,"" I'm asking where you think we should be looking. I'm not basing my opinion solely on aggregate polling data personally, more towards general trends that have surprised me since the COVID-19 pandemic started. 

for example, when considering popularity for reelection: the [Financial Times-Peterson US Economic Monitor](https://ig.ft.com/ft-peterson-poll/) has only 32% of respondents answering ""yes"" to the question ""are you better off now than you were four years ago,"" lower than any president who won reelection. that response is also lower than Bush Sr., the last one term president, at 38%. 

looking at early voting data (cast votes) from key swing states: 

* 43% of cast votes in FL were by Democrats, compared to 36% Republican
* 70% of cast votes in PA were by Democrats, compared to 20% Republican
* 47% of accepted (and returned - NC distinguishes) votes cast in North Carolina were by Democrats, compared to 20% Republican

additionally, NC and FL are helpful indicators as they actually count absentee/mail ballots before election night, so we'll have a decent indicator of the election trend early on. 

the data compiled [here](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/Early_Vote_Analysis_10_18.html) notes that ""both of these patterns are different from prior elections where registered Republicans tended to request more mail ballots and return them at a higher rate.""  you can take a look at the data yourself and see where I'm getting my numbers from. 

additionally, we are still in a recession due to COVID's affect on the economy. only one post-1900 president has won reelection in a recession, and none post-WWII. (Hoover and Carter as the biggest ones that come to mind). but we've also had very few one term presidents overall, so being the incumbent can't be discounted.

That means that Covid has killed more Americans age 25-44 in 2020 than: homicide, suicide, heart disease, cancer, HIV, liver disease, diabetes, or pregnancy/birth complications. In fact, Covid is the #2 killer of young Americans, second only to unintentional injury.",boston

gold2727,"I think it has a lot to do with:

1. Masks. There is less virus being transmitted. If I have it, less virus gets through the mask. If you have a mask on, even less makes it through. So you start the infection with a decreased viral load. 

2. Treatments have improved, doctors, nurses, etc. have better learned how to treat the virus 

3. Younger people don’t care and are mostly the ones getting sick 

4. It’s killed off a lot of the most vulnerable already

But death rates are absolutely down. At the peak of the summer spike there were 70k new cases a day, deaths only peaked at 1450 nation wide. This is opposed to the 40k peak of new cases and 3000 peak of new deaths during the spring surge. Almost twice as many new cases resulted in half as many deaths.

What the 2 month “lockdown” did was get us off of that drastic curve that we were at back in spring. What’s scary is that it’s not unreasonable to look at the charts from today and see how easily we can be right back to where we were at the height of the curve in a month.

Fortunately deaths are still low and hospitalizations aren’t close to the overwhelming amount they were back in April and May but my understanding is that those numbers don’t tend to increase until a week or two after a positive test so this week will be key in looking at those stats.

Steroids probably help some but again, not enough to explain such a massive decrease in mortality.) As for 3, the studies actually show mortality down across all age groups so don’t think that’s playing a role. 4 could play a huge role, but I think that would be more likely there is some as yet undiscovered genetic predisposition to severe COVID, rather than who we typically think of as vulnerable, as again, these people with typical risk factors (is age, diabetes, obesity, etc) are doing significantly better than previously.

I think such a huge magnitude of difference suggests a change in either virus or host factors, and I think we just don’t know yet, and maybe never will.

FostersFloofs,"No? There's only one thing that went wrong: someone accidentally made an elevator do weird shit, and after it did weird shit, *she kept messing with it.* She wasn't ""carrying"" a package, she was trying to cram a huge package into the elevator.

She stuffed an oversize package into the elevator, it tripped the door interlock switch, the elevator moved but stopped (presumably the package shifted as the elevator went down) and then she messed with the package a bunch more, causing the sensor to trip again, and the elevator to move again. The description isn't super specific, but I'm guessing she was trying to pull or push on the package, and when the elevator suddenly resumed going down, taking the package with it, she fell in through the open door...or she was hanging onto the package, the package was pulled out of the elevator, and then she was yoinked into the shaft.

Most sane people, when an elevator does something unexpected and end up in a decidedly non-normal state, go ""oh shit, well this is above my pay grade, time to call someone.""

There's a well known security hacker who does exploits involving elevators and he always starts his talk with a safety speech, and the tldr is: **elevators operating in normal mode are incredibly safe for anyone in the cab. If anything goes wrong in an elevator, stay the fuck where you are, and call for help.**

 He continues on to say that there are lots of injuries and deaths involving elevators, but none of them involve people who were fully in the elevator cab, doors closed. The injuries and deaths almost always involve people outside (ie on top of) the cab, or forcing doors open, or trying to get in or out of an elevator that is clearly malfunctioning (like the doors not fully open/closed or the elevator not fully arrived at the correct level.) Basically: people inadvertently trip interlocks in the process of getting in/out, or the interlocks were failing and intermittent...the elevator moves, and the person gets squished.",boston

&gt;John Ioaniddis's IFR paper was a pre-print too. IFR 0.25% or lower. Now it's WHO-published.

Sure - but it's not a great idea to rely on data that's not peer-reviewed (again, see hydroxychloroquine); it's the whole point of the peer-review process. And all of the peer-reviewed studies, three of which I linked in my first reply, are claiming 50-67% infected to reach herd immunity. 

&gt;That's wrong, actually. More like 19%. Remember the CDC's estimate of infections at 5-10x cases in the US? 7.5 x 8.3 million / 328 million = ~19%.

That estimate predates the research they put out a month or so ago, tagging the rate at 10% in the US. I'm sure you've seen it so I won't bother googling. 

Italy did have a long lockdown - but this is happening across Europe. Belgium is an interesting case study, because it was hit hard in the first wave and right now has 930 cases per 100k - second worst in Europe. The death rate is lower so far, maybe because we've learned a lot about what treatments work, maybe now it'll affect mostly young people, maybe they burned through the vulnerable population, maybe the rise in cases is still new and people haven't had enough time to get very sick and die yet. Time will tell. Hopefully the hospitalization and death rates stay low; I feel so bad for doctors, nurses, everyone who works in a hospital. 

China is very interesting. I have a few friends living there, and they've talked about all kinds of interesting, extremely invasive, technology that we don't use - contract tracing data farmed from cell phones, no opt-out possible.

It's better than not caring and being part of the problem. I don't understand why this is such a difficult concept to grasp.

It's similar to climate change. The biggest are huge corporations and one person being really good at recycling isn't going to save the world, but that doesn't mean we should just all go around mindlessly consuming things we don't need and throwing our trash wherever we want either.",boston

&gt;&gt; This thinking is in line with the conventional wisdom that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000 because of the razor-thin margin between the two major party candidates in Florida. Of course, such logic falls apart when you consider that almost 13 times as many registered Florida Democrats voted for George W. Bush as they did for Nader, and that [liberals-for-Bush exceeded Nader's](https://reason.com/blog/2016/08/03/ralph-nader-did-not-hand-2000-election) total vote by a factor of more than three. [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/)' exit poll posed the hypothetical question of who third party voters would support if the race were only Clinton and Trump, and both Johnson and Stein supporters appeared to support Clinton over Trump by about 25 percent to 15 percent. But 55 percent of Johnson's supporters would have just sat out the election, as would 61 percent of Jill Stein supporters. According to [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html) exit polling, a whopping 63 percent of voters who declined to cast their ballot for the two major party candidates said they would have not voted at all in a two candidate race.


Incase you need more reasons Nader wasn't the problem, [here's a list](http://www.cagreens.org/alameda/city/0803myth/myth.html)


&gt;Ah yes, this 170 year old example really proves the point.

And what has changed so fundementally about politics that the same principle wouldn't apply? Does the fact that the concept of gerrymandering is 208 years old mean that it doesn't still happen today?


&gt;And what grounds do you have to think that democrats will do nothing if they control both houses and the executive?

The fact that they did very little with the first two years of Obama's presidency when they had a super majority and all three chambers, besides passing a right wing healthcare plan writen by the Heritage Foundation.

I always found qPCR with fecal-containing samples to be very noisy. There's just a lot of contaminants (I think it was different polysaccharides) at random concentrations that inhibit polymerases at different levels and carried through the nucleic acid extraction with the appropriate kits. Adding in everything else that comes with wastewater (other biologics, total water usage, weather, etc.) and all the factors that can affect viral stability (detergents, pH, temperature, etc.), a single gigantic point may just be a weird outlier, like the one above 100 at the start of September. In this case, also, at the raw data: 

Date|South|North
:--|:--|:--
10/14/2020|103|71
10/16/2020|105|101 
10/18/2020|106|214 
10/19/2020|227|109 

North doubled to 200 and then fell back to 100, followed by South doubling from 100 to 200. 100 is still a concerning level, but it's not the eye-popping three-fold increase of the 60-70 level we were seeing earlier in the month. 

If this keeps going for another day or two, hit the big red panic because there's a lot of undiagnosed virus. If it drops back down into the 90-100 range, keep the big red button around because it's still not great but don't press it yet.",boston

I disagree with your point on NAFTA. It's not worth the loss in jobs and onshore manufacturing just to get cheaper prices. Increased productivity doesn't benifit the working class much since wages are now entirely detached from productivity. 


And if Biden is so willing to listen to his allies, why have there been no reports of him floating any progressive in any position in his administration? It's easy to make policy promises you don't plan on keeping, but personel is policy and I would trust his unity commission promises a lot more if there were progressives in his cabinet. He seems far more willing to reach out to neoconservatives than progressives or even trump supporters, unless you think trumpers are a fan of John Kasich and Jeff Flake.

On top of that, his outright refusal to ban fracking is deeply disappointing and I'm not a fan of all the saber rattling with Iran that's been going on.

caldera15,"I don't think there is a problem with the people who become Republicans, necessarily. There absolutely is a problem with Republican ideology, or what modern conservatism has come to represent. If people want to be redeemed then they can be but we have to starve them oxygen, which starts by making it socially unacceptable to be a Republican. Give them the option to get out but if they don't take it, they should be shunned. 

Great strides have already been made in the past several years, though it will probably take some time before demographics get to the point where conservatives are truly an outcasted minority. The issues are exacerbated by our archaic, racist and undemocratic constitution which allows people with outdated views to hold onto unearned power. That just means we'll have to wait longer, hopefully not too much longer lest climate change kill us all in the meantime (probably already gonna happen). 

To put it another way, you don't approach somebody brainwashed by a deranged cult and think ""well, let's find common ground with the cult!"" Maybe in talking to somebody you act like you are trying to find common ground, but that's an ACT. You NEVER take the ideas of the cult seriously, or the cult has won. A big reason the Republican party is so much more dangerous than the ""actual cults way scarier than the Republican party"" is because they've been taken seriously too long, which has allowed them to accumulate power and become normalized. 

At some point the bandaid has to come off and yes that's going to mean some people - many even - cannot be saved even if very deep down they are ""decent people"". No we don't need to kill them but we do have to marginalize and remove them from greater society, and not let them back in until they confess their mistakes and seek accountability for them (which rarely happens, at least the way we are now).

Even if in your home...if someone breaks in and points a gun at you, and you yourself have a gun, you cannot legally shoot them until you've exhausted all other avenues of avoiding the situation (running away, jumping out a window, moving to another room, etc.)

And if you're in your home and someone is outside, your home, even if they're breaking down the door, you cannot engage until they physically threaten your life.

Nomahs_Bettah,"&gt; If truly left is full-on government ownership of the means of production (of everything), Sanders doesn’t even make the middle-school JV team

""left"" as a political model is of less value than ""how he compares to other countries' governments,"" because the argument was whether or not Sanders and/or Biden is far left or center left or center right in a specifically political context. that requires a primary comparison to other governments, not a theoretical model. 

&gt; A bunch of comparisons to countries I never mentioned is also irrelevant. If full on left is, let’s say, North Korea, (yes, I know, totalitarianism /= communist, that’s a different discussion) then let’s not pretend that a politician pushing for single-payer healthcare is somehow out of mainstream of human society or radical.

my point was that Sanders is pushing for a single payer healthcare system that eliminates private insurance that duplicates government service, covers vision and dental, and is free at the point of use. that *is* a radical proposal. he is not pushing for the single-payer healthcare systems enacted by the countries often cited as their models (namely Scandinavia, Western Europe, and the Anglosphere). single-payer as implemented in the UK or Canada looks *very* different from his specific version of M4A. 

moreover, you did bring up those countries, by virtue of the fact that in your original comment, you stated that ""Biden Is objectively a bit right of center in a global political context. Even Sanders is only slightly left of center from that frame of reference."" a global political frame of reference must include the global spectrum of countries - including conservative countries (and I even discounted, off the bat, any straight theocracies).

my objections in the first place were not about ""no one should ever reform healthcare in the US,"" they were about Sanders's specific plan to do so. the current system could be improved, nor have I ever disputed that. you yourself acknowledge that there is a range of healthcare that your coworkers have enjoyed in their home countries, and many of those systems enjoy objectively better standards of care, lower tax burden, and are more appealing to the American population. a public option is the universal healthcare system in a huge portion of Europe: Biden would not be center right. banning private insurance and private hospitals would be a radical move well outside the boundaries of most social democracy and labour parties.

ennnculertaGM,"&gt;I don't deny that time and distance are a factor. I *do* deny that the virus is only transmitted if you're within 3 inches of an infected person, which is literally what you said and what you're continuing to stand by.

Try and quote me. I find your hyperbole pretty useless to further this discussion. 

&gt;In addition to time and distance, there is evidence that airborne particles can be moved by HVAC systems in such a way that people become infected. Yes, it's ""just"" three cases, but how many cases are there - with peer-reviewed evidence - of an infected individual visiting a place with an HVAC system, spending some time there, and not infecting others? I'll gladly accept peer-reviewed evidence of this. To my knowledge, none exists. As such, and again, because I have to take a medication that suppresses my immune system, I'm operating with caution.

That means nothing about the virus being infection-capable - this is something that is regularly brought up by the experts who debate this. Which is also why there's only a handful of incidents regarding airborne spread that have been verified. Do I need to bring up the fact that the medical community has been doing nothing but looking at this virus for 9-10 months and they only verified that handful of incidents? I mean I don't know how to tell you this, but the vaccine isn't really going to .. guarantee much of anything. It might cut an already miniscule risk in.. half? You're going to go from being cautious to ... not caring after 50% better odds? If you were cutting certain death in half, I'd see a point. You're cutting 0.0001% in half. I could be off by a factor of 10, but I'd still not see the point of cutting that in half. (If you do the math out.. before your die... which is related to the IFR, you need to get infected... and before that... you need to meet an infectious person... likely ... yes... close up, for a long time). How did you live your life not worrying about ALL of the other diseases... and get so caught up on ONE?


&gt;There are at least a dozen hospitals in Florida with no ICU capacity. Not including the DOZENS with only a couple of beds left. There are entire counties without a single ICU bed available. Were you one of the Republicans eating up that rhetoric about death panels killing Granny a few years ago? Cuz I got news for you. Eventually - they've only fully reopened for a few weeks - they're going to have to triage these patients and decide who lives and dies. I'm not wasting my time looking at GA or TX because you have absolutely zero intentions of taking in any information that threatens your worldview.


Lord have mercy... out of how many hospitals is that? 50? 100? Florida literally re-opened to full capacity and for large events. And that's it? Do you also know that the hospitals run at like 85% ICU capacity as per the norm? And that some patients in there are there out of an overabundance of caution and could be moved out for COVID critical patients, if necessary? Source: random doctors talking about this on the Internet. What's the problem? Where's the wave of death? It's not here. Thankfully. Don't tell me to wait two weeks, either. :)


&gt;Your Sweden claim is patently false. Sweden has the 12th highest per-capita death rate in the world. In fact, Sweden and the US, which has never had broad regulations, make up a unique category of two - the only two nations in the world that have failed to reduce mortality rates over the course of the pandemic. You, or whoever you're getting your information from, is also cherry-picking comparisons - Swedish schools shut down when Massachusetts schools did, for example, even if bars never closed. Sweden's death rate is significantly higher than neighboring countries - a much better comparison than to the US.

Which is pretty impressive, isn't it? They are supposed to be #1 by a factor of TEN? Imperial college predicted 80,000 dead Swedes? Only 6,000 died. 

https://hailtoyou.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden-actual-deaths-to-april-23-vs-imperial-college-projection-1.png 

For quick reference. It's old but illustrates that point. 

No lockdown. Minimal restrictions. Think about it. You know what else is interesting? They are slowly dropping out of the top 10.. then top 15... Hmm. So, what good are these lockdowns/masks if without them you still beat places with strict COVID rules? 


&gt;Yep, the virus has a ~3% death rate, much lower than initially feared. It can still completely overwhelm our hospitals if we let it burn through the population.

Pardon? The virus has a death rate for all of 0.13 - 0.25%. If you are quoting 3%, you are stuck in CFR land. The WHO just peer-reviewed a paper from a statistician/biologists's  (John Ioannidis ) that purports the IFR at 0.25%, but claims this is still likely too high. 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8843927/Just-0-05-healthy-70s-Covid-19-die-disease-study-claims.html

My friends, you are so far off base here... even after you said you knew the difference between the IFR and CFR? I guess maybe you meant broadly.. oh well. 

&gt;how are we still locked down???? What is locked down???? Restaurants are open for indoor dining. Bar seating is open. Movie theaters, open, gyms, open, salons, open, indoor skating rinks, open. Like - what are you upset about, exactly???? Our unemployment rate decreased by 4.9% in August alone. With even more restrictions lifted in September and October, we should be making great progress towards economic normalcy. I think we're striking a great balance in this state, keeping our hospitals operating normally while reopening almost everything.

It's getting better, but the ""order food with drinks"" non-sense is silly. At this point I would also say the useless maskarading in those purely voluntary places needs to go. I'm fine with 75% capacity limits, too, just to pacify some people. Transit/bus masking? Hell, grocery store masking? Fine. I've had it with the debbie downer buzzkill of ""mask walking"" to the bathroom at restaurants though. 

So yeah, if Florida can open and things are OK. We can too. Fully. Open. Like they did a full month ago. I'd bet our combined T-cell and B-cell immunity threshold level is probably higher here than in FL because of how hard MA got hit in February (well before March lockdowns). Want to read about that? This is currently.. seemingly being debated (the t-cell immunity part).. but here it is:

&gt;T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in unexposed people; however, the source and clinical relevance of the reactivity remains unknown. It is speculated that this reflects T cell memory to circulating ‘common cold’ coronaviruses. It will be important to define specificities of these T cells and assess their association with COVID-19 disease severity and vaccine responses.

*Full Post Text:*

PSA: Regarding Sexual Assualt, Rape, and Sex Trafficking. If you are a  parent, a young adult, or anyone who has a few minutes. Please read  this.

This is something I debated posting about due to the sensitive nature  but I think its too important not to share and get the word out to as  many people as possible. 

Over the weekend, my 2 friends and I took a day trip to Boston MA.  While everyone was masked up, the parks were still pretty filled up and  everyone seemed to be enjoying the day and going about their own things.  As we were walking through a park, I noticed that these 2 gentlemen (in  the picture) had walked in front of us and start talking to these 2  younger girls (early 20’s) we had been walking behind for maybe 5  minutes prior. These girls clearly had no idea who these guys were and  the girls definitely were not showing interest in pursuing a  conversation (Guys were asking questions like “where do you live, etc”).  Immediately I got a very bad feeling and suggested to my friends that I  intervene, however they suggested we just keep following them and see  what their intentions were. After keeping a distance but keeping an eye  on the 2 girls, we noticed there was a 3rd gentleman also in the same  group who was trailing behind them. Overall just very unnatural  behavior. We waited another 2 minutes until I decided to finally butt in  and try to get these girls out of this clearly awkward and unsettling  situation. I walked up behind the group of 2 girls and yelled out “Hey  Jammie, how are you!!!”. This immediately prompted the guys to walk off.  (Another red flag). You could see the fear in these girl’s eyes and  they couldn’t stop thanking my friends and I for looking out for them  and helping them out of the situation. They walked with us until they  felt safe enough to go off on there own again. We thought that would be  the end of our fun. But It wasn’t. These guys were clearly on a mission.  

We spotted them again, this time, one of the guys targeted a single  young woman who was walking alone. Once again. It was clear she did not  know this man and was not comfortable with the situation. This time, we  didn’t have a great way to intervene. This guy knew we were following  them and they all knew what we looked like. We continued however to  trail behind them as they walked with this girl. We didn’t want to lose  sight of them. As time progressed and my friends and I got more uneasy  about the situation, I called the police. I was on the phone with the  operator updating her of the guys (and girl) every movement,street  change ect. All while doing our best to keep a distance. Within 5  minutes we got 2 police cars to our exact location and 4 officers to  assist with the call. They got sight of the gentlemen and set up  officers at each exit of the park to see where they headed to next.  (Corner of Newbury Street). 

Unfortunately, we don’t know how the situation unfolded from there.  But we informed the officers of everything that occurred over the course  of the hour and did everything we could to make sure these girls were  safe. It was the most unsettling experience I’ve witnessed. I wanted to  write about this to keep the conversation going that things like this  happen. For all we know, these guys could’ve killed those young girls.  Who knows what could’ve happened. The important thing is that if you see  something, please say something. You might just save someone’s life in  the process. The movies we see regarding sex trafficking and things like  that might not be as far fetched as some people think. The first 2  girls we helped out were from New York. They clearly had no idea how to  leave the situation they were in. They were in a public park, with many  people around. This can happen anywhere. So be aware of your  surroundings. Don’t be afraid to ask someone to come with you to an  unknown place. We need to stick together to keep each other safe. What  we witnessed that day was what felt like pure evil. And I hope those  guys get what they deserve. Thank you to the Boston Police Dept. for the  incredible response time and for taking our call as seriously as we  did. You may have saved a life.",boston

“ First of all, there's not just one. There are 14 of them. They run each county’s Probate and Family Court system, something Ianella, who was also the Suffolk County Register of Probate for 14 years, said is more important than people realize.

""It is the only court that at some time everyone, and I mean every citizen, is going to have to walk into,” he said.

itsonlyastrongbuzz,"People enter LTC facilities to rehabilitate from a procedure until they're self sufficient again. That's what long term care means, it means you require a bed longer than the hospital is willing to provide one... LTC facilities often stipulate that their admissions require a minimum stint in an ICU at a hospital, they're not just taking in 97 year olds who've given up on life,.

People in LTC facilities aren't happy because they're people who were recently healthy enough to be independent, and are desperate to recover and get back to their normal lives.

They're 60 year olds who had a hip replacement that got infected during surgery and need time to heal. Or a 45 year olds who had throat surgery and are building their strength back up to get medically cleared to fly back home.

There's typically an older population at LTC's as they need more time to recover from operations, but they're not invalids, they're not in hospice, they're trying to heal and go home.

I don't know if you're more callous or naive, but either way, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.",boston

The Minuteman bike trail is very nice but be respectful of the cyclists. I also enjoyed the Somerville/Cambridge Community Bike Path when I lived off of it, and the easy access it gives to places like Fresh Pond. 

Charlestown, Beacon Hill and the North End are also incredibly enjoyable to walk around for the architecture, I even sometimes follow the Freedom Trail just for the fun of it. 

Might be unpopular here, but I honestly enjoy walking through Downtown Crossing on Washington Street, huge fan of pedestrianized streets and Washington Street fits the bill!

As for views oriented, Deer Island has incredible views of Boston, the harbor islands, the ocean, Winthrop and Logan. Revere Beach is also good for plane spotting and waterfront views, as is the waterfront in Lynn and Swampscott. 

The Fells are great if you want to be in a forest, and also gives plenty of good views! Best trails include the Rock Circuit Trail, Skyline Trail and Reservoir Trail. Horn Pond in Woburn is also nice and can give you a good view of Boston from the top of the ""mountain.""

singalong37,Way back when those buildings were built the streets were full of street cars and people walked from the cars to the stores and then to home. At the time they were called taxpayers because the assumption was they were temporary and would eventually be replaced with multi stories. After automobiles came to dominate the landscape nobody wanted to build Multi story buildings because they would bring more competition for parking spaces and the shops need the spaces for their customers. The guy who does the city beautiful YouTube channel made this point about strip malls. I think he’s right and it applies to the older streetcar line shops as well. It doesn’t make me furious; what I like about it is that it makes greater Boston a walking environment.

Unfortunately, hospital beds are almost entirely used up: https://www.kxnet.com/news/local-news/north-dakota-hospitals-are-nearing-capacity-for-icu-beds/

More nurses could help unlock some unstaffed hospital beds in the state.

It is completely against what the experts are telling him needs to be done and what they’ve been telling him through the summer as well. It’s always been 4 things. Stop indoor dining, shift all schools to online, and reduce gatherings to 10 or less, and stop other avenues where people can gather indoors and be in close proximities for long periods of time (movie theaters, sports, gyms, etc).

With those measures in place, there’s an astronomically low chance of covid getting out of hand in our state but he’s content with how many are getting sick right now and not willing to make the tough calls that would force some of the more inconsiderate to reel it in so everyone can stay safe.

Fiancees and I’s goal this year was to make new friends in the city. Haha for that happening. We were supposed to get married in September. We’re serial planners so had it all laid out a year in advance. Getting out of contracts and telling friends and family to cancel was a huge multi-month headache. Some relatives are still bitter we cancelled.

Family on both sides are pushing us hard to get a house outside the city, as we’re in a 1 bedroom but making it work. Been to a couple open houses as we kept lowering our standards and looking further and further away. Found something that I could see us making work, put an offer in the whole 9 yards, only for someone to drop $600k + in cash. That really fucking deflated me. Deleted Zillow off my phone.

Jamal Bowman said that of the 1.2 million phone calls made by his campaign, over 800k were by Sunrise. And considering Markey is one of Sunrise's two champions, they were gunning hard for him. They did everything from knocking on doors to making [stellar ads](https://youtu.be/DDg5glIt_0A).

There's a really great podcast where they interview Sunrise folks about the Markey campaign if you want to [check it out](https://open.spotify.com/episode/776vmPa1XQ8Dc9RVCgQG2m?si=NDGsKpZ3TmScFgRXdUUwxg).",boston

mgzukowski,"Essential what it would allow is you or your mechanic to access your vehicle sensors wirelessly. So currently you need a scan tool. The cheap ones can pull ""Code"" which tells you a general error. (Like $20)

P0301 is a misfire on cylinder 1. Now that is very general. That can be caused by a bad sparkplug, a bad ignition coil, low fuel pressure, faulty wires, a bad crank sensor, etc. Etc. 

Now an midrange or expensive tool $200-$5000 tool can read the direct sensor data. So you can see that cylinder one is not getting proper fuel pressure, so more than likely that would be a fuel injector. 

You would now be able to do that with an official phone app. One that manufactures can't lock that data out of. Which they like to do from time to time. 

The official diagnostic computers are dealer only. So every few years the makers of the third party tools have to reverse engineer the software on the car to make the tool usable on that car. That makes them expensive. 

On some cars a simple task like replacing a brake caliper(A hydraulic clamp that squeezes the brake pads onto a rotor to stop you.) You have to plug in a diagnostic computer to bleed the lines after. (Air can compress so in a hydraulic system that's not good.)

The fear is also that now that cars can be updated remotely, the manufacturer can lock out the third party tools from looking at sensor data when ever they want.",boston

tbhole,"One Massachusetts State Police captain, alcohol on his breath and an open beer bottle rattling around his unmarked cruiser, led Saugus police on a chase and had to be wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.

All of these troopers are on patrol today, having escaped termination from the state’s largest law enforcement agency despite crimes or serious misconduct.

A Globe review of the department’s internal affairs files shows the agency rarely fires troopers almost no matter what they have done. The Globe found only a handful of examples of firings in the last decade.

Meanwhile, dozens of troopers found by internal investigators to have broken the law remain on the force today. They collectively have 29 sustained charges for assault and battery; 19 alcohol and drug violations, including four OUIs; 17 charges for harassment, including three for sexual harassment; another 17 for improperly using the state’s criminal background check system.

Another trooper was caught providing unauthorized police escorts for funeral processions and taking cash under the table, while also routinely skipping portions of detail and overtime shifts for which he was paid.

And then there is the trooper duo — academy classmates and close friends — who regularly hung out with known criminals. One trooper traveled and partied in Las Vegas with people tied to organized crime, coming under federal scrutiny after he admitted he improperly ran background checks on behalf of drug dealers linked to an illegal gambling operation.",boston

If you disagree with me, that’s fine. But please inform your boss and coworkers you can’t handle not have the ability to properly dispose of your dog’s shit. Please cc their management and possibly vendors you work with. This will ensure they review everything you do daily at work and can make sure you aren’t doing anything illegal or catastrophic. Most likely, they will part ways with you and that’s the ethical decision. Second, put your dog up for adoption, three seek in patient mental health treatment. 

I’m serious about you informing your boss about your logic and behavior. I guarantee if anyone reviews multiple aspects in your life, behavior and problem solving skills they will find immature and narcissistic tendencies that lack basic logic.",boston

I can go to the license office anywhere in the state of Alabama and pay the $100 to reinstate it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and so on. Even if I was in Massachusetts right now I cant go in to an RMV without a reservation. I'm not worried about breaking the law at this point as its already been done.

Efficient_Pack934,Boston has a housing issue because they won’t build larger buildings with affordable normal sized apartments and houses in the already developed areas.
