It's not as lively as Lakeview but close.  If you can get a better living situation by moving there, I would definitely recommend it.  Before COVID it was *the* rising neighborhood in the city, and you can probably get a good deal on rent if you move there soon.

I could see instances where they may plow it slightly faster, but not to the amount where it would impact plowing schedules on the multiple hundreds of other streets they need to plow. I see it as a situation where the plowing still happens on time and provides the same benefit without the parking ban.

wikipedia_text_bot,"**[Plaza on DeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza on DeWitt)**

The Plaza on DeWitt was completed in 1966 as a residential apartment building at 260 E. Chestnut Street in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago. Originally called the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, and designed by Bangladeshi-Pakistani engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan while he was working for Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, it was the first building in the world to implement the tubular construction method later used for the World Trade Center. The 43-story tower accommodates 407 residences and is the tallest building in Chicago to be clad in travertine marble.

There will be variability but we are nowhere close to being overwhelmed and have plenty of capacity.

1. How does plowing on equally- if not more -traffic-dense and ""vital"" streets not require the signs?  I mentioned this elsewhere but if the ""easier"" plowing actually helped commuters why wouldn't more people want this on busy, commercial streets like ashland, western, fullerton, etc.?

tie_dye_guy,"I never claimed them to be common, lol. And very few so far makes sense. But again, cases are on the rise.

So let's talk R0 values, which is the number of people someone infects. In Chicago last I heard it was about 1.2, which means every person infects 1.2 other people. So if I have 5 people with COVID they're likely to create 6 more cases. Those 6'll create 7 and so on. If I have Covid chances are good the people I infect will be those closest to me, family I live with, co-worker around me, etc. who will in turn infect others close by.

This creates a localized cell of the outbreak in my immediate group. But someone in my group might also infect someone outside the group but adjacent, like a regular customer at the store someone from A works at, or the co-worker on a different team, so if I'm in cell A, this next person will be the start of cell B. Cell B will grow and spread to Cell C, D, and so on. 

Eventually after the people in A have gotten over Covid and sufficient time has passed for the virus to mutate, another cell may pass it back again. Maybe it's Z or ZZ or ZZZ, could take a while, but when that happens the whole thing could kick off again. ZZZ could infect A, A could reinfect B or maybe F or Y, depending on the degrees of separation. The spread won't occur in the exact same order, but it could tear through the same people none-the-less if those people don't take care.

Not a lot of cases of reinfection yet doesn't mean we aren't a mutation away from a really rough time. And it's incredibly dangerous and irresponsible to act like 25 confirmed means we don't have to worry. I remember when the number of confirmed cases in the US was single-digit, and look where we're at now.",chicago

tie_dye_guy,"You clearly don't understand immunity...

So the flu vaccine, I'm sure you've heard of it. Well every year scientist decide what strain(s) of the flu are going to be a problem, and develop a vaccine for those strains. And you might be immune to that strain more-or-less. But, another strain can still infect you. You aren't immune to the flu virus, just that strain.

That's why I used the word ""mutation"", viruses mutate all the time. Sometimes they mutate in a way that changes their properties in a way that allows them to overcome an immunity. Because whatever was fighting off the original virus won't work on this new version.

So yes, these people may be immune to a certain strain, but not the type of virus that's still spreading.

And it will keep mutating as it comes in contact with new people, new animals, new viruses, etc. And what I'm saying is that mutation may make it something different enough that people who fought Covid off already aren't immune to it.",chicago

This needs to be built into the 911 system, I think, not have a separate number to call. Indeed that's how CAHOOTS works in Oregon.  But yes that means more training for the 911 dispatch so that they're dispatching the teams as needed and not just sending police on every call. 

Ages ago before 911 people had to make the determination if they need fire, police, or an ambulance and then call the proper number, and in the time of crisis sometimes individuals who are there don't even make the right call. Having a single emergency number was a step forward. 

The system needs to be fixed so that people are not hesitating to call 911 for help, worrying that someone is going to end up shot by the police.  City of Eugene does seem to have a handle on that key dispatch piece, hopefully Chicago can get assistance or learn from them.  Regular 911 should be able to get you the mental health with no police team, when that's what your situation calls for.

Meaning the program has already collected $95 million in collected funds and $228 million in funds that will be paid in at a future date as projects break ground. Basically every tower downtown or project in the West Loop pays into this now. The brand new Bank of America Tower at 110 N Wacker just paid in $22 million for example:

The idea is to make future benefits more reasonable in order to be able to actually come close to funding the insane benefits already conferred. 

The truth is Madigan and the corrupt Illinois state Democrats will not allow their golden goose (labor) to compromise on anything. And why should they? We, the voters, have no power here. There is no legitimate challenge to the state Dem party in Springfield and they already have a constitutionally guranteed stranglehold on this cash flow for their special interests. They would be insane to give that up. 

The funny part about this vote is that the taxpayers finally woke up to this and rejected their attempt to further consolidate power by eliminating one of the few taxpayer protections in the constitution. The public basically told Pritzker and Madigan to fuck right off with their latest attempt to milk us.",chicago

WhalomPark,"Maybe this is me being naive but I think they really need to reserve amber alerts for straight up abduction/kidnapping situations, not ‚Äúnon-custodial parent ran off with child‚Äù situations.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those are serious situations but almost amount to a very serious domestic dispute.  The city doesn‚Äôt get alerts for mass shootings, high speed chases, etc... for them to be blowing up every citizens phone when the abductor is a parent seems a lot different than like, someone swooped a kid off a playground and threw them in a van and sped off.  

Again there‚Äôs really no way to sugar coat what I mean, but amber alerts should be reserved for the most serious situations imo.  Custody battles get messy and the police should be put on high alert in those situations, but I don‚Äôt know that they warrant a call to action from the entire state.",chicago

marticcrn,"Ok - let‚Äôs take these one at a time:
1. Can‚Äôt cap the pensions. Illinois constitution prohibits that. The reason the pensions are out of control is because the city council routinely doesn‚Äôt make a full payment. During the ‚Äò90s and even as recently as the lest several years, the market gains have more than covered the city‚Äôs contribution, so the city just didn‚Äôt pay up those years. 
2. Most of the bureaucracy has been gone for years. Most of the non-CPD, non-CPS jobs are staffed at minimal levels - for example, there were only 14 public health nurses for the City of Chicago.  If you want to continue receiving city services, someone actually has to do that work.

emsenn0,"Your tone sounds antagonistic; maybe that's just an enthusiasm to learn, but it's off-putting. These are incredibly complex topics, and you seem to be trying to ""gotcha"" cultures as logically flawed based on your impressions of things, by making statements about your conclusions, putting the work on me to challenge them. Rather than assume that long-surviving cultural beliefs are flawed in ways you can spot without even knowing them, try assuming your knowledge is incomplete and try and see how you can fill it in. There's a big difference in respect shown between saying ""If we followed \[your\] tradition now we'd be neck-deep in garbage,"" and ""I don't understand how following your tradition wouldn't mean we'd be knee-deep in garbage. Could you explain?""

To demonstrate the sloppy logic present in your questions: The OP of ""remove them from the ground"" and my statement of ""don't dig"" are both very different than your ""anything dropped on the ground has to be left there."" You're implying Lakota folk won't pick up a dropped penny, because I'm saying we're particular about when we choose to dig into the Earth.

I've never been to Chicago, so I thought I'd ask here. What are the neighborhoods that Chicago natives tend to avoid? Relatedly, what are the neighborhoods that you guys generally think of as safe?

Which places have good access to grocery stores, gyms, etc. that would be ideal for an apartment?

That stuff specifically is; waiting for funding, applying for more funding, getting denied funding, looking for volunteers, organizing all of these people and applying to the FDA or their respective agencies in their countries. A lot of these clinical trials had basically blank checks and a lot of willing volunteers. The FDA is obviously looking at the vaccines stat, as top priority.

Just because there was corruption to get a result does not mean that the end result was in fact a negative outcome.


Also, costs go up over time. We didn't act as a nation to replace old nuclear power plants. Now we have to keep them running or spend 4-20x as much to replace them with something else. Yeah, that's actually how much it costs in capital expenditure to replace a functioning nuclear power plant in good condition with a replacement energy source. The fee on your bill for that keeps overall energy prices lower than if we were dependent on natural gas, coal, wind, hydro, or solar for energy.

I don't think you realize how big of a number [200,000,000,000](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) is but its up there. You don't get that many dollars by earning it, and you don't keep it by minding your own business.

aubcol,"MOVING! To Chicago from Washington state.

I am nervous. Ive been spoiled here in the Pacific North West- the landscape is nothing to compare to if you‚Äôre an outdoor person. But were ready for a temporary change. 

We‚Äôre thinking about moving here to advance our careers. We have family here that we can be closer to. We‚Äôre buying a house right now in WA before the makeover goes overboard and renting it out but we‚Äôre looking at a temporary life in Chicago. 

1. Tell me about Chicago please. I‚Äôm also looking it up everyday until we decide. It‚Äôs just nice to have real testimonials. 


2. Outdoor life- lakes, rivers, camping and more. I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews. 
(Also someone told me there are leaches in the water. üòÇ üíÄ tell me if this is real. I‚Äôve been researching but can‚Äôt find anything. Please tell me it‚Äôs fake as rivers/ lakes are huge where we‚Äôre from. ) üíÄ

3.the areas. It‚Äôs so hard to move so far away not knowing the areas- Even if you google it. You never know till you‚Äôre there or speak with people who live there 

4. Housing/ pay: I‚Äôm finishing up dental hygiene school. (It‚Äôs extremely difficult to get into schools here  in Washington (eastern wa) so we figured we do a little traveling and finish degrees that way. 
Houses are so cheap! (Not a bad thing at all, just less than what we‚Äôre used to. Your first house you buy is usually 250k or more(and that‚Äôs eastern wa - watch out for western. 
I just kind of want a testimonial of how people feel with the wages/living cost. 

5. Weather! How is it? We‚Äôre from Spokane, Washington. It‚Äôs nothing like Seattle. (Everyone thinks all of Washington is the same) eastern and western wa is contrasted. Eastern doesn‚Äôt rain as much- At all. We get tons of sun and high temps in summer. It‚Äôs hot, dry - not humid. (Not to mention HALF THE PRICES WOO) We also get TONS of snow. 2008 being 94 in of snow. Usually being 45 inches per year from November till March on average. 

I‚Äôve been researching - and I‚Äôm really excited. It‚Äôs temporary, but it‚Äôs going to be a good experience.

Lionheart1224,"I like the idea of the K Line, but I worry about:

1) cost. The city doesn't have the funding for this, and asking congress to find this in this time of division is...well, being overly hopeful, shall we say. The price quoted in 2011 was over 6 billion. Almost a decade later that number has to be a few billion higher.

2) structure. The reason that most of our rail system is above ground is because of the geography: because Chicago is built on Lake Michigan flood plains, the soil is too soft in most places to support a subway. I'm not sure how this could work for such a huge project.

3) willpower. The CTA seems more keen to first finish the Red Line Modernization Project, then expand the Red Line further south (there are plans for this somewhere on the CTA's website, I remember). Somehow, I doubt there's much drive to build a north-south line that far west, even though it's sorely needed to serve the communities there.

A smaller concern is using the Kimball train yard. Makes sense in concept, but with the increase of commuters living near Brown Line stops now, I have to think think that making the yard house trains for another line would tax the Brown Line and negatively affect service, just as it starts to need more. And the yard can't be expanded: it's super small and smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood with no room to realistically expand.

Otherwise, I *love* the idea of a K Line and hope something like it comes to pass. When you think about it, having the line either start at Kedzie or LTC is the best idea.",chicago

LeskoLesko,"Reports that suicides rates are on the rise have been debunked; that isn't how the epidemiology of suicide works.

The rise of overdoses is not related to suicide -- it's a tandem issue combined with the decades-long problem of opiates largely caused by the pharmaceutical industry. Those are addicted people who are not specifically seeking to kill themselves.

Listen: I'm clearly a bit over the top here, and I do apologize, but for context earlier today I was preparing a lecture on the Paris Siege of 1871. You should up on it. 6 months of starvation, kidnapping children to eat, fighting over bits of your dog, breaking into the zoo and eating all the animals, while the Prussians threw dead bodies into your city. One of thousands (tens of thousands?) of documented events in human history where people gave more than this to survive. It's difficult to go from the realism of human history, sacrifice, dedication, and survival to people pretending this is about freedom and oh no I have to miss a single year of Thanksgiving.

Isolation has been a part of human history as long as there have been humans. If we didn't keep telling each other we don't have to cope, we could cope. And other areas of the world are coping. We just think we are special and shouldn't have to cope, and that's why our numbers are the worst in the world.",chicago

Plus, why would I keep the gun I have for defense in pieces? I need to whip that shit out of my
Holster when someone tries to car jack me.

That‚Äôs like when people say to keep your gun in the basement, ammo in the garage, and barrel in the attic. There isn‚Äôt a point to have that for defense. You keep that pistol in a mini vault gun safe.

There are serious issues with IL gun laws being too hard and fast and keeping people who need mental health treatment from receiving it.

ttmc_leo,"Cool job just making shit up.

CPD officers have a handful of duty weapons to chose from to use on patrol.  Depending on what year the officer was hired, they are allowed to carry a weapon from a list of approved sidearms (which simply means someone hired 10, 20, 30 years ago is still allowed to carry the weapon they started with).  

Currently, for anyone hired post-2015, there are a few Glock models, a few Springfield Models, a few Sig models, and 1 or 2 Smith and Wesson models.  

All of them have to be 9mm and striker fire.  Absolutely no modifications, even cosmetic ones, are allowed.

Even the weapons CPD officers are allowed to carry off duty in their personal lives are highly regulated.

CPD personnel are also the only citizens in Chicago that are required to register all firearms, even ones used for sport and hunting.

This is literally publicly available information, which makes it that much dumber that you would try to make up lies about it.

Republicans have increasingly relied on dirty tricks to further their agenda. The filibuster used to be a tool you could rely on. And pretty soon it will be entirely removed.

The other problem is that there is no unity within the democratic party. You have ""blue dog"" democrats who really are just democrats in name only. They vote for abortion restrictions and tend to vote against any legislation that is in any way even a millimeter left of dead center.

So when democrats were trying to tackle healthcare after Obama's election, we were 1-2 votes shy of enacting single payer healthcare. There were only a few votes short of single payer. So they had to come up with another plan, hence the ACA. And even then, we had to push pretty hard for the final last vote to approve it. We really BARELY got the Affordable Care Act passed.

Democratic legislation getting passed usually has a snowballs chance in hell. And realistically nothing will change under Biden that requires any cooperation between all three branches of government.

AwesomeScreenName,"More fun facts: The airport was renamed after Edward ""Butch"" O'Hare, the first person from the navy to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II.  Butch was lost in the Pacific, presumably shot down by the Japanese, in November 1943.  Orchard Field was renamed in his honor in 1949.

Butch never lived in Chicago, but his father (also named Edward) did -- the elder Edward O'Hare was a lawyer for Al Capone.  In 1930, the O'Hare turned on Capone and went to the IRS.  He acted as a confidential informant for the government, and helped get Capone sent to jail.  O'Hare was the person who let the authorities know Capone had rigged the jury, which led to the judge swapping the jury with the jury selected in another trial (if you've seen the Untouchables movie with Costner, DeNiro, and Connery, you probably remember the scene).  The elder O'Hare was assassinated in 1939, almost certainly on Capone's orders, though I think it's officially still an open case.

dogs_wearing_helmets,"&gt; BLM rallies = totally fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Reopen IL protests = super spreader events.

Man, I remember this. Before Floyd was killed, there were some reopen protests here, never more than ~500 people (realistically, most were closer to ~100), and the prevailing argument here on /r/chicago was that everybody who went should be absolutely banned from visiting any hospital. The argument was that while they had a point, it was NOT ""the right time"" to protest, due to COVID.

Then George Floyd was killed and over fucking night that whole thing changed and now protesting was totally fine as long as you wore a mask (even though, if you look at actual footage from the BLM events, there were tons of people not wearing masks).

Later on, people were saying that it was because we now have a better understanding of COVID and know that it doesn't spread readily outdoors. Except that position switch happened in a single day. It's not like there were new COVID studies released that day or anything.",chicago

Conservatism in the United States is a political and social philosophy characterized by respect for American traditions, republicanism, limited government, support for Christian values, moral universalism, pro-business, opposition to trade unions, strong national defense, free trade, protectionism, anti-communism, rugged individualism, advocacy of American exceptionalism, and a defense of tradition and Western culture from the perceived threats posed by communism, socialism, and moral relativism.As with all major American political parties, liberty is a core value.American conservatives generally consider individual liberty‚Äîwithin the bounds of American values‚Äîas the fundamental trait of democracy; this perspective contrasts with that of modern liberals, who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice and emphasize the need for state intervention to achieve these goals.American political conservatives believe in limiting government in size and scope, and in a balance between national government and states' rights.Apart from some right-libertarians, they tend to favor strong action in areas they believe to be within government's legitimate jurisdiction, particularly national defense and law enforcement.Social conservatives, many of them religious, often oppose abortion, civil unions, and same-sex marriage (i.e.",chicago

HammerTimeHTFU,"&gt; 8 months in and we have not had hospitals overwhelmed

But if we keep trending the way we are we might just get lucky enough to experience that.

&gt; it‚Äôs clear that the majority of risk is towards people over 70 years old.

True, but per the CDC hospitalization are up, and although the majority of those are people 50 and over, people in the 18-49 demographic are still being hospitalized at rate of about 150 per 100K, which is not negligible. Most people who are hospitalized do suffer chronic symptoms that last for months after discharge. And we don't know enough about long term affects of COVID to know what kind of strain this could place on the healthcare system for years ahead. 

 &gt; we need to shift the focus towards personal calculation of tolerable risk.

People don't live in a vaccum. You're not just deciding what acceptable risk for yourself is, you're deciding for everybody that you come into contact with. More, importantly this doesn't work. People won't act responsibly. If we lifted restrictions tonight the bars would be packed to capacity in a matter of hours. I was living in Phoenix this summer and until there were mandates I would estimate &lt;20% of people were wearing masks. When they lifted restrictions in May-June every bar and restaurant was jam packed like were were back to pre-COVID.

&gt; t‚Äôs undeniable that lockdowns have had a horrible cost on our society

You're asking a question that implies that I'm white and racist. Why would I genuinely answer such a loaded question?

&gt;A person of any race may agree with the president that ""too many"" non white immigrants are coming into this country

Oh. Are we just straight up lying about merit based immigration now? I actually worked in corporate immigration for the first two years of his presidency. So you unfortunately picked the wrong subject to lie about.

&gt;Certainly the demonization of non white immigrants is a central reason Trump gets compared to a Nazi.

Honest questions. How does it feel having such a poor argument against a president, for which there are many strong arguments, that you have to resort to lying and spreading disinformation?

carexgracellima,"Restaurants are being shut down because that's something that can be shut down. It's not like you can just shut down a nursing home. The idea that cases 'start' somewhere is nonsensical - it is spread and we are trying to control the rate of spread. A governor or mayor only has so many levers. As long as people are going around acting like things are normal, going to parties, and in some cases knowingly spreading it, it's not going to slow down. I get that many people are being forced into semi-public situations for work but many more are knowingly entering them for no good reason. If that weren't the case it wouldn't be spreading!

Edit: I'll just give my own example...I did some volunteer work outside with masks a few weeks ago. Someone else who was volunteering with me tested positive afterwards. The person who tested positive contacted the person who organized it. They contacted everyone else and all of us quarantined for 2 weeks.

More accurately they were just exhausted and trying to find the best way to disenfranchise as many people as possible. Madison himself said the electoral college was born out of them being tired and bored of debating. 

Beyond that, functionally it doesn't do anything to prevent big state rule at all. The only states people spend money on in elections are the upper Midwest as well as Florida, and the sunbelt. 

If the idea was it would force people to pay attention to the small states it hasn't accomplished that at all. It has made ten states have national elections that matter and the rest of us are window dressing. 

Grade schools try to pass it off as a stroke of genius so as to further mystify the founding fathers whereas, just like most of there ideas, it is littered with problems. For example the entire system of American constitutional laws was designed based on the ideas that political parties wouldn't form. Political parties formed about 8 years later.

Barbie_and_KenM,"&gt;‚ÄúOne question I have ‚Äî and I know other restaurant owners have ‚Äî is  where is the information that proves that our industry is a  super-spreader of COVID?‚Äù Priolo asked. ‚ÄúWe are all masked, and we use  PPE as well as training. I would love for them to share the contact  tracing information that says that we are the spreader.‚Äù

I completely agree.  I think this decision is very arbitrary.  Where's the data that restaurants are what's causing the spike?  If there isn't any, then why is this one specific industry being penalized while all other ""at-risk"" places are still open (gyms, movie theaters, beauty salons, etc)?

It seems to me that it's not possible to contain the virus in the US at this point.  Too many different rules between different jurisdictions (not to mention the rule-breakers).

* Statewide: 643 **COVID Patients** occupying 3,787 staffed ICU Beds (i.e. 16.9% of ICU beds are occupied by COVID patients)

Which doesn't seem that high, but if you look at total ICU utilization:

* Statewide: ICU Beds = 1,271 beds available of 3,787 = 1 - 1271/3787 = 66%  ICU utilization (both COVID and non-COVID)

* Region 11 (Chicago) ICU Beds = 297 beds available of 1,055 = 1 - 297/1055 = 72% ICU utilization (both COVID and non-COVID)

bandofgypsies,"Yeah, 100%.  That's part of this issue. Do you think being wide open and free to interact is going to solve anything long term? They're clearly not interested in shutting things completely down again if it's avoidable, but part of that is keeping the disease spread manageable. If we keep public spaces like this open and the resurgence continues, then we have little hope for starting off winter on the right foot. It's a balancing act to give us a path forward. Maybe there's never a vaccine. Maybe there is. But either way we need to provide time so that we have a chance to get there and aren't overwhelming our healthcare infrastructure.

Of course an extension of UE is necessary. This should be done at a federal level, 100%. Painting dinners at the governor doesn't help this. He's the only reason we're not even more screwed than we are today. We may get to a point where we just open up eventually and deal with it. Hard to say. But we need time to get more information and understand the implications of that. It feels like a lot of people are getting antsy, and that's understandable, but we've only been navigating this for ~7mos. While that feels like a long time, in terms of developing an effective medical understanding and approach to handling a brand new form of disease, it's a miniscule amount of time. 

Please, don't mistake me saying we need to close down for me suggesting that it isn't a total dumpster fire for a lot of people.

There at least seems to be a majority here that everyone wishes the federal government would step in.  I'm not sure what the city or state can do WRT financial assistance, I don't see that they have the money, and they sure can't print it.  (I wonder what the Fed is doing WRT loans to states and municipalities?  They talked about it, did that get off the ground?)

----

I have been wondering, what would happen if we didn't close up?  Would hospitals become overrun to the point where they have to turn away patients?  (I'm not actually sure if Illinois and America would let it get to that point on any significant scale.)

Or would infections continue to increase but naturally taper off, for some reason?  If they did, would that be because people are largely staying home of their own volition?  I think there's already some evidence that a lot of the hurt restaurants and other businesses are feeling is less due to lock downs, and more due to consumers being unwilling to engage in what they perceive as risky behaviors, such as dining out.  In that case, it seems like the restaurants and bars are going to go out of business anyway, lock down or no.

I honestly don't know what the answer is.

I think there are a lot of people on this thread that are really scared and depressed as they worry about their bills and their future.  I am really, really sad‚Äîand *mad*‚Äîfor what you're going through, and I hope that we can get you some help one way or the other *soon*.

tpic485,"&gt;It's a wash fare-wise to the transit agencies.

No it's not.   Not even close.   On page 9 and 10 [here](https://metrarail.com/sites/default/files/assets/planning/ridership/2018_summary_results_report_final.pdf) you see the total number of  Metra Electric by station.  Those travelling downtown from city Metra Electric stations are not a small number.   All these individuals have the option to take a quick bus route downtown (every station on the Metra Electric line is very close to a CTA express bus that uses Lake Shore Drive for the vast majority of the commute these riders would be making south of downtown) but they have chosen to spend about 75% more to ride the Metra because it may be slightly more convenient for them.   Now, the transit agencies lose out this premium that people are WILLING TO PAY and forego this revenue that they can spend on operations.

So it means less service or a higher fare increase than would otherwise be made to make up for the loss of revenue.   And that's if we are going to talk about ""transit agencies"" broadly as if the CTA and Metra are the same entity.   But it 's important to point out that it's mostly the CTA that will be hurt by this since the CTA will lose ridership and Metra will gain ridership that may or may not completely offset the loss from reduced revenue.   The CTA serves a higher portion of lower income passengers than Metra so this adds to inequity issues.   Also, the people who are choosing to ride the Metra Electric right now even though they have a roughly equally convenient alternative at a lower price obviously are more likely to be higher income since they aren't as concerned about costs.   So those who we are going to reduce fares as a result of this move are those who need this type of help the least.

This is insane.   There are a lot of unmet transit needs across the region and the city in particular.   There are improvements that could be made to speed up the commute for people who really could use a quicker commute or that would encourage more people to use transit, such as more reverse commute service to and within the suburbs (once the pandemic is over).   Reducing fares for service to people who already have the ability to commute in almost the exact amount of time to generally the same places for the price that the fare is being reduced to means there is less money for these more important priorities.",chicago

North_South_Side,"Back when I was a teen in the '80s my friends and I used to explore all over Caldwell and LaBagh Woods. One time in a clearing in LaBagh, we found some kind of a doll and a spot where a small fire had been built a few nights before. Attached to the doll was a notebook with all kinds of angsty teen satanic bullshit (complete with misspellings and stuff crossed out) written in it. I can't remember most of what it was but on the back someone had written ""When I die, have no pity. Bury me in LaBagh Woods city""\*

Later that year, some summer night in LaBagh, we were off the trail in the wooded part. We heard some voices and walking near an overpass was a group of 5-6 people dressed in white robes walking in a line. We freaked the FUCK out and high tailed it out of there.

I think my brother still has the notebook/poem thing. We stopped hanging out wandering the woods after dark after seeing the group in white. Granted, they were likely stupid kids like us just taking Satanism a little too seriously. But it creeped us out in a major way.

^(I remember the rhyming line because it became an in-joke/freak out material for my group of friends and we would quote it to each other over and over.)

You're completely wrong about track/exotic cars in a way that clearly demonstrates why we need gun laws.

Sports car speeds *must be* limited (by a physical governor on the engine or software) for them to be street legal.

Similarly, you can go to a heavily regulated gun range in Nevada and send nine yards of ammo through a .50 caliber machine gun BUT that gun ain't legal on the street.

Hence with guns, just like with cars, you have to figure out a way to reduce danger to the public. Reducing rate of fire (both by disallowing fully automatic weapons and limiting the size of ammunition clips) is a highly sensible solution if you wish to preserve individual gun rights... which you've only had since 1994 but that's a whole other topic.",chicago

At first I was like, ""Woo-hoo! New knives! Coffee table! Blender, maybe!"" I was in my very early twenties and needed stuff for my new apartment. But I literally (and I mean that word in the literal, not figurative, sense) spent an hour trolling the aisles in a brick and mortar store going, ""Hey! I need some of these! But these are crap . . .

Everything I laid my hands on in that store either fell apart in my hands or promised to do so the second I got it home. But it was a hundred dollar non-transferable certificate that I had to use in the store. Screw it. I'll take these ""never-need-sharpening"" kitchen knives. (They lasted two months).

# Looking for stories about Cumberland (Blue Line stop / west Higgins Road/ Surrounding area)

Hi, I know this is a strange request, but hoping a few folks might be interested.

I'm an independent filmmaker who makes short experimental documentaries/essay films (for fun, not for a living). A few years back, I stayed at the Springhill Suites on West Higgins a number of times for work trips, and I did a lot of filming at and around the Cumberland station and on the Blue Line trains.

I've tried multiple times to form this footage into a finished film, but with no success. What I would really like to do is put the footage over the stories of others who either use the Cumberland stop regularly, who work or live on or near the stop, or simply have had a unique experience related to the stop or area. While I'm hoping to get actual Chicagoans to tell their stories, I'm also open to tourist stories as well (seeing as the stop is so close to O'Hare, I expect there will be a lot of those).

If you have a story to share, feel free to post it here, DM me, or (my ideal), record yourself telling the story and DM me a download link.

This is a labor of love (I never make any money off of my films), so unfortunately I can't pay anyone, but I'm happy to include your name or Reddit username in the credits if you want to share it (not necessary though--anonymous stories are fine).

Thanks for indulging me, and I really hope to hear your stories!",chicago

1. A bartender has some idea of how many drinks someone has had, regardless of how drunk they look, simply because they are the ones serving drinks. They can‚Äôt possibly know the person‚Äôs viral load.
2. There are well-established procedures to determine if someone is intoxicated and shouldn‚Äôt drive. The number of  exceptions (people who would fool an examiner and are nonetheless unable to drive) hardly changes the risk calculus here.
3. On the other hand, nearly everyone who has carried the virus has been, at a point, both asymptomatic and contagious. These people are not the exception.
4. Once you identify a drunk person, you can follow steps to ensure they will not kill anyone on the street. You don‚Äôt really have that certainty with corona. 
5. There isn‚Äôt a multiplying effect to drink-driving fatalities. Driver kills 3 innocent passengers in a different car, that‚Äôs it. A CoV carrier may infect 3 people, and they may go on and infect 9, who would go on and infect 27, etc.

TONS. So many employees cannot wait to get back to the office when it is safe to do so. Not all, but many. Look at all the tech companies gobbling up big blocks of cheap office space right now. These are companies with all the technology in the world to have people work from home indefinitely, but they find huge value in a physical workspace.

aSchizophrenicCat,"It almost feels like you‚Äôre trolling at this point. Again, I‚Äôm not claiming anything I say as fact. The data to disprove *or prove* the point isn‚Äôt transparent enough to draw conclusions. Therefore it‚Äôs worth considering the position, opposed to dismissing. To say it‚Äôs moot, and that schools being open is mostly irrelevant, means you don‚Äôt don‚Äôt even care for the scientific method... -_- If the data was transparent, and if we had decent contact tracing, then the source of outbreaks would be apparent. 

But sure, let‚Äôs just pretend in-person schooling has had no effect on covid spread. No way a classroom full of children or teens, who come home to greet their parents every day, could ever result in spread. They are all surely conscious of cleanliness, and would surely never be asymptomatic if they were positive - anyone suggesting otherwise must be ill-informed on the subject.... right? 

1 covid carrier holds the possibility to infect 2 out of 20 people they come in contact with. Now imagine the kids who are asymptomatic - imagine those kids have working parents who imply they must go to class. Even if this % of students were at 1%, we‚Äôre still looking at a fairly large rate of spread. With masks, spread can surely be reduced, but spread can‚Äôt be eliminated, especially when friends get together after school. When parents don‚Äôt care that their kids go to school in person, then why would the kids think twice about hanging out with friends after school? 

Schools being potential super spreader hot spots isn‚Äôt exactly rocket science - to dismiss it because of non-transparent data is pure ignorance. Deny it all you want.

Its not my fault you assumed I only meant Chicago? Illinois? when we are talking about a national spike in covid cases, this isn't a illinois only surge. It's a national surge so you have to look beyond your narrow parameters. 

Seasons aren't changing in every state. But you don't seem to grasp that.

myacc488,"&gt;No crime was being committed.

Pointing a gun in someones is aggravated assault with deadly weapon. Again, the fact that it was fake in the end doesnt matter, because theres no way of knowing that ad the situation unfolds. 


&gt;The video doesn't. Cops lie and the system lies to protect the cops.

The video is grainy and it might actually show just that. We have no reason to suspect the police officer had any intent of harming someone when it wasnt necesary.

And please cut the conspiracy theory bullshit. You have no proof and believing one is usually a sign that the person in question has a hard time navigating and understanding reality. 

&gt;I think he was a coward who murdered a child because he was incompetent at his job and a racist who doesn't value black lives.

Sounds like an opinion formed based solely on internet comments. First of all, hes not a coward because he went there when scared people called him about a man with a gun. And there are many videos where cops get killed if they let a suspect make the first move.

Then you have absolutely zero proof that he was even slightly racist. And it proves that you're view of the situation doesnt come from careful examination, but mob induced rage. What evidence there is shows that cops are more likely to shoot suspects of their own race, meaning that black men are more likely to get shot by a black cop then a white one.

And he values black lives more than you ever will. He put himself in a situation that was described as extremely dangerous in order to protect a black neighborhood from violence. Have you ever done such a thing?

&gt;Here is a story about a woman who was murdered in her own home while she was sitting on a couch by a cop who shot her through the window. I could keep trading stories with you of cops murdering innocent people all day.

What does that have to do with the video I posted. I showed you the video how an innocent looking guy who's not cooperating can turn on you in a second. This explains why police often react when some people who never face violence argue the suspect hadn't done anything. The cops see where its going, it someones not cooperating, things are about to turn ugly.

Overall, out of a 100 million police interactions each year only 1 or two results in the death of a truly innocent person. It's a non issue. And no, this cant he brought down to zero in a country this size, someone will always slip up, and given how guns are ever present in the US, slip ups can be deadly.

There are fire fighters who turn out to be arsonists, yet we dont deride firefighters because we know they all wanna help people and put themselves at great risk in doing so.  The fact that there are some bad guys among them means nothing.

You are obviously an extremely privileged person who never experienced violece, let alone dealing with someone who's truly unhinged and armed. What you're doing is grotesque and it's the largest moral panic to have ever existed in this country, and its ruining lives.

1. Single parent households
2. dual-working parent households
3. Households with school-aged children not old enough to be on their own for extended periods of time
4. Households with children with special needs
5. Low-income households that can't afford basic necessities, let alone ""gap year"" luxuries
6. Some parents who are flat out not equipped to educate a child on their own.

There was **nothing** easy about making the decision to put your kid in school or not the beginning of this semester.  Early childhood education is critical to a person's development later on in life, so much more so than our current public education system and overall ""work"" system in America seems to understand.  There can absolutely be a significant and long-lasting impact on a child's life when early childhood education suffers, in everything from meaningful relationships to lifetime earnings prospects.  There's mountains of research on this.  To think that a child can be be pulled out of school for an entire academic year, home-schooled by someone with no training, or even ""tele""-taught, with no down side is foolish.",chicago

I just don't understand how you can ""enforce order"" without armed men actually enforcing it.  Reforming police is badly needed.  I don't understand the nuances of ""defunding police"" I guess, because it seems like a bad idea if you still want order.

Of course some owners are filthy rich, have outside investors to shoulder the risk, or incorporated more smartly than being personally liable for their loan.

The holiday commemorates the forty years the Jews spent traveling in the desert before entering the Promised Land. The temporary booth-like shelters are meant to evoke the fragile dwellings from that time. Part of the holiday observation involves having meals inside (and, I think, praying in there too).

Forget the hospital for a second. How many folks can afford to be sick for 1-3 months? Just a general at home sickness being stuck in bed, but unable to work. Do you have 3 months of sick time? Oh and we're starting to learn that immunity does not last very long. Of the confirmed reinfection cases, all of them got sick within 3-6 months of their first infection.

So if COVID knocks you on your ass for 3 months, you've just expended most if not all of your immunity.

A woman just died from her 2nd COVID reinfection. There are a lot of young people who might not die, but will constantly be at risk of a very lengthy illness.

You think your job will put up with you being out for 3 months?

I have a friend who works in the ER and was pregnant during the first months of COVID. She caught it late in her pregnancy. Her placenta fused to her uterine wall in the last month of being pregnant, and they suspect it may have been due to COVID. She nearly died.

Yet folks in the know tell me that carp is a good eating fish. Turns out there's several types of carp and some are not bottom feeders at all. Also the smaller they are, the closer their flesh to tasting like other neutral/sweeter white fish. 

If you make patties or fishsticks and deep fry the heck out of them, I would eat them. Also, gefilte fish is sometimes made out of carp, and I enjoy eating gefilte fish.

Ampu-Tina,"Allow me to clarify some very salient points.

1. The police have the right to defend themselves.  However, as shown by literally every other main on the planet, murdering people is unnecessary in order to defend yourself.  Further, the killings that the cops are being taken to task for are enthusiastically not in self defense.  Or are you saying that the four copies that murdered George Floyd were defending themselves?  Tamir Rice?

2. The police are not empowered to decide someone's innocence or guilt, not are they empowered to execute people for crimes.  Further, seeing that the people they look have not had the benefit of trial, as guaranteed by their rights established by law, they literally cannot be considered guilty, as they have not been charged with our convicted of a crime.

3. The position that cops have to protect us is problematic, as the issues being put forth - namely, the police killing innocent people without consequence - slow clearly that they are failing to do their jobs.  Doctors are tasked with saving lives, and if they fail to do so, if a patient dies due to their failing to do their job properly, they face investigation, lawsuit, and lots of job.

4. The reason why people of color and other communities that are disproportionately affected by the police are upset about this is that they are facing directed aggression and targeting in their communities.  You may take a moment to remember that the entire reason why gay rights exist is that they were being targeted by the police for harassment and illegal arrests, to the point where a riot happened.  This has happened in quite literally every disaffected community in the country, and you would do well to remember that the criminal justice reforms of the 90s specifically targeted people of color.

Again, the issue isn't that the police are killing people while defending themselves.  The issue is that they are killing people for no fucking reason, and facing no punishment for it.",chicago

You're disrespecting them because you think they're too mean when their protecting you from others. This shows truly grotesque levels of privilege.

And to disrespect someone who's protecting your ass from danger is just the most obscene thing in the world. You clearly have never faces real violence, and are one of those people who have completely inane fantasies about how they would handle it. I bet that if I so much ad pushed you, your knees would start shaking and your voice begin to quiver.

Youd probably have an involuntary release of bowels if you had to face an armed maniac who just assaulted someone, and there was nobody else to call on.

As for your point about peeing and eating, obviously people can take a break and come back.   Not everyone pees and eats at the same time.   That's why, for example, the police can operate 24 hours a day and seven days a week even though sometimes police officers need to pee, sleep, and eat.

lordcat,"&gt; What if the protesters simply refuse the police's request to submit to an arrest and simply run away from them, which should be pretty easy to do?

That would be them dispersing.  We got here because they refused to disperse, so if they disperse then they're now complying.  At that point, arrest numbers shouldn't matter because the situation has been resolved.  And it should be pretty east to do because that's what the CPD would have been asking them to do.

&gt; What if it never gets to the point where there's any physical actions taken from either side?

If they aren't being violent, and the CPD does not have intention to arrest them, then why should CPD become violent against them?  Why escalate to violence when they could simply start arresting them until the rest disperse, or they've arrested all of the law breaking protestors?

&gt;  Those suggesting that force be prohibited in all nonviolent protests even if unlawful would prohibit police making any attempts to arrest someone if they are resistant at all as long as the person being arrested isn't violent.

Resisting the physical act of being arrested is considered a violent act.  If a cop tries to handcuff you and you pull your hand back, that's considered an act of violence.  If you physically place yourself between a cop and someone they are actively trying to arrest, that's considered an act of violence.  Doing anything other than running/dispersing to prevent yourself from being arrested is considered an act of violence; and even running/dispersing can be considered an act of violence in some circumstances.

Once an office starts arresting someone, there is very little that that person can do (other than fully cooperate) that can't be considered an act of violence.",chicago
