ncburbs,"&gt;I’m talking about neighborhood spots within easy walking distance. 

that's a pretty big omission from your original comment then, you should go back and fix that. All you said was 

&gt; but I honestly don’t understand why anyone uses these apps

with no mention of only ""easy walking distance"" places. And it's very normal to order delivery from places a little farther away. 

&gt;Also, “safer” for whom, exactly?

pretty much everyone. A single delivery driver can make deliveries for dozens of people throughout the day who are ordering food, which means dozens less people walking around or otherwise commuting. Even if that one person is walking around for a little longer outside, that's overall more safety (and he can probably drop off several on a single route at a time, so it's more efficient too).",nyc

Beliavsky,"[Ungated](https://archive.is/y50wh).

Here are three paragraphs that I think are important:

""The problem with New York’s mental-health system is not a lack of funding for community alternatives. The problem is the community alternatives themselves. Psychiatric hospitals and inpatient psychiatric wards primarily serve three types of service-recipients. First are those in acute crisis who may be suffering a psychotic break or who have attempted suicide. Second is a proportionately small group of seriously mentally ill people who have been deemed incapable of living in the community, often called “long-stay patients” in reference to their protracted length of stay at a state psychiatric hospital. Finally, there are forensic patients, who are committed following an insanity plea or an adjudication of incompetence.

In New York, forensic patients are served in specialty forensic hospitals, which have undergone comparatively little “transformation” since the OMH overhaul began. The number of budgeted forensic beds in New York State fell from 756 to 720 between September of 2016 and 2020, a decline of less than 5 percent.

The people primarily affected by these bed closures, then, are those facing a psychiatric emergency and the long-stay patients who have been discharged following years of living in a dedicated psychiatric facility. Reducing inpatient capacity potentially deprives them of access to a critical link in the continuum of care if they face a psychiatric emergency or fail to thrive in the community.""",nyc

Louis_Farizee,"&gt;I don’t really understand why you’ve waited this long to presumably “follow the rules” / listen to medical professionals only to throw it away at the end?

That's a good question, and deserves a respectful answer. 

In a nutshell: I do not think the amount and extent of restrictions are commensurate with the risk. I understand that a very small number of people will die or get sick if they get infected, but it's been clear for months that most people will not, especially if they are young and healthy. And while I am willing to make small sacrifices to mitigate a small risk and large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk, I am not willing to make large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk. It doesn't make sense, and I'm not going to do it. 

Now, I do understand that some people are more vulnerable to this thing than others, and I am willing to make a large sacrifice to protect them. I hate my mask, but I wear my mask to protect the vulnerable. I am going absolutely insane without my usual outlets and social activities, but I understand that sacrificing those social activities helps protect people who have a good chance of dying or experiencing severe symptoms if they get sick, so I am going to do what I can to protect them. 

But once those people have the opportunity to get vaccinated, the calculations change. And nobody has the right to force me to make large sacrifices to mitigate a small risk. 

That's how I feel, anyway. I hate all these restrictions. They've been very hard on me. I'll follow the guidelines to prevent widespread suffering, because that's part of being civilized. But once widespread suffering is off the table, so is my compliance.",nyc

No, the 100-mile border zone powers 1) only apply to federal law enforcement, not state/local law enforcement (except for state/local cops 'deputized' by federal officers) and 2) more importantly, [only apply to **enforcement of immigration law**](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone):

&gt;Border Patrol, nevertheless, cannot pull anyone over without ""reasonable  suspicion"" of an immigration violation or crime (reasonable suspicion is more than just a ""hunch""). Similarly, Border Patrol cannot search vehicles in the 100-mile zone without a warrant or ""probable cause"" (a  reasonable belief, based on the circumstances, that an immigration  violation or crime has likely occurred).

AceContinuum,"&gt;What kind of papers do they want to see? As citizens we're not obligated to carry proof of citizenship nor do we have green cards.

In theory, at *interior* Border Patrol checkpoints, [if you're a U.S. citizen, you have the right to refuse to show your ID](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/cbp-cant-detain-domestic-flight-passengers-refusing-suspicionless-id-checks). As you note, U.S. citizens are not required to carry proof of citizenship when traveling domestically within the country.

In practice, I strongly recommend carrying proof of citizenship, such as an Enhanced driver's license or a U.S. passport card. All too easy for a power-tripping agent to break the law and illegally arrest you for not being able to prove your citizenship on the spot; this [apparently happened **300 times over 4 years at a single bus station**](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17490904/customs-border-protection-patrol-checkpoints-100-miles-legal)!

Much better, if it comes to it, to be able to prove your citizenship on the spot if forced, and then file a complaint afterward, than get (illegally) arrested/detained for hours on end and have your day (or more) ruined. Either way the agent is unlikely to face serious discipline for breaking the law, so you might as well do yourself a favor and minimize your risk of getting illegally arrested.",nyc

AceContinuum,"There's another line the right wing has drawn, too, which has never made much sense to me. At the state level, they support voter ID laws almost reflexively, the stricter the better. They also support tying issuance of state driver's licenses to not only proof of identity but also proof of citizenship. At the federal level, they support mass domestic surveillance conducted by the NSA, which scoops up - among many other records - every website everyone ever visits within the U.S.

Yet, despite being *perfectly fine* with ever-more-stringent state ID requirements, and despite being *perfectly fine* with federal mass domestic surveillance, they [cry foul at the very idea of a national ID card](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/24/blocking-the-pathway-to-a-national-id/).

Seconded.

Like if you're currently in between jobs, or a 'house spouse', or something, maybe you don't mind the effort in return for a small stream of spending money. But if you both already have full-time jobs, I really don't know that it's worth the hassle of becoming a small-time ""car landlord"".",nyc

Wrong. Go to any walmart or home depot, people are fucking packed like sardines. And even if what you said was true, they'd *still* be spreading COVID because it's a mass gathering of people inside a building. The mental gymnastics you're doing  here are absolutely insane.

&gt;The evidence is how many regularly get sick after attending defiant idiotic services. 

How many people died from COVID infections due to going to church? How many people died from COVID infections via attending the multi-thousand-people BLM protests that took place on the street every single day over the last 6 months?

I truly think all of it, including the narrative of widespread systemic racism, was blown way out of proportion and unfortunately, the police were vilified as a result.

I think you can make a pretty compelling argument that we're witnessing the failures of rolling back broken window policing.  We no longer enforce the low level quality of life crimes that reduced crime levels from what they were in the 1970s and we're seeing an uptick in more serious crimes.  Couple that with a revolving door/no bail system and an anti-cop attitude among millions of New Yorkers to further embolden criminals.

It just seems to me that pulling police from outside turnstiles and making that yet another low level crime we just don't enforce is a real good way of increasing more serious and violent crimes.

Why is this regulation so narrowly focused to store-front only point of purchase businesses?

I'm also interested to hear which group(s) have standing to have been caused harm by not accepting cash? I'd guess its low-income peoples who don't have cards? You could easily argue that banning card-only business could effect these people, however they do have access to pre-paid cards and businesses that operate non-cash are highly unlikely to have customers that are cash-only.

If NYC/State took a more light-handed approach and the healthcare system becomes completely *inundated* (again) with dying people gasping for breath, I cannot imagine that that will leave them unaffected. Never mind the years of their life lost to stress and lack of sleep.

There's something also to be said about older generations feeling like they're being condemned to death or people, regular people with regular per-existing conditions feel like a loaded gun was pointed at them because of a local/state's government's attitude about Covid-19.

Even in market-rate apartments, to submeter electric heat a landlord  must apply for permission from the Public Service Commission and provide detailed accounting of tenant costs and associated rent reductions.

Other than by developers. 

The envision Soho Noho plan is a good example. 800 affordable units. 800. In exchange for changing the zoning of an entire neighborhood, including allowing big box retail in areas it's now prohibited. The city could take any of the lots it owns and just have one building built that would be all affordable housing and house 800 people. They own several. But RE developers would not profit from that.  So make dramatic changes to a large area instead. It's madness. And it happens over and over again.",nyc

The truth to schools is that the vast majority of city students are already remote.  Less than 30% opted in for in-person instruction, and even fewer turn up.  The whole experiment was doomed from the start, and should have been targeted towards the at-risk/higher need population.  They should have focused on kids who need to be in school because they don't have supervision, don't have the tech to do remote learning, have food security issues, special needs, etc.  This way, they could have covered the kids who need it most as close to 100% as possible, as opposed to trying to cover everyone between 20-40% (assuming 1-1.5 days/week in in-person instruction for blended learners).",nyc

Doesn't matter. Try running it non-profit. Or anything at all.

Yes it's an essential government service. Which is why it's long been used as a way to extort city taxpayers. 

It was built a hundred years ago, and shouldn't only need upkeep and maintainance, which should cost much less than what we pay.

To not privatize it, is to simply allow the MTA to keep demanding more and more, even as users dwindle. Tokyo is the biggest city in the world and their metro has been privatized for the same reason.

&gt;Zou got out of his white Audi and punched a 35-year-old man in the face. The victim was vying for the same spot. A man who came to the defense of the victim was struck by Jonathan Zhang, 34, who was with Zou.

&gt;Zou and Zhang got into the Audi and tried to ram the two victims. The car jumped the curb and smashed into a bakery at 41-39 Kissena Blvd. The duo were then apprehended by officers from the 109th Precinct.

&gt;The *Daily News* reported three women were hit by flying debris and suffered minor injuries. The two men who were allegedly assaulted also reported minor injuries. They were all taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital–Queens

&gt;Police arrested Zou at the scene for reckless endangerment and assault. Zhang was also charged with assault.

Silver_kitty,"I know the warning has already expired, but in the future, taking shelter in a tornado warning involves getting away from windows. Ideally a basement if you have access to one, or often into the bathroom (because have fewer or at least smaller windows). If you are sheltering in a bathroom, you would lay down in the bathtub and put at least a blanket or preferably your mattress over top of you to protect yourself from falling debris. 

Also just in case people aren’t aware, Tornado Watch means conditions are right and we’re watching to see if one forms, Tornado Warning means we’ve actually seen one and expect more.

cambriancatalyst,"In high school, we would hangout at night in riverside park doing what teens do. One time we were wrapping up and discussing food plans for afterwards. I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up getting dared by a friend that I couldn't finish 5 Koronet slices. I was young, dumb, plastered, baked, and hungry as fuck, so I eagerly accepted. The deal was if I could finish all 5 of them they'd be on my friend, but if I couldn't I'd pay for it all. 

So we emerge out of the park and walk over, we enter, push a bunch of tables together, order 5 slices for my challenge and whatever else everyone was having, and the show began.

I wipe out slice #1 without problems and naively start to believe I can actually do this. Slice #2 wasn't too bad, a bit slower, but still manageable... I was feeling OK until about halfway through slice #3 when, all of a sudden, I did NOT feel OK anymore. As a matter of fact, I was absolutely DONE, but continued trying to push through.

The thing is though, at this point, others in the pizza place had overheard my friends and my dumbass self going through this ordeal and I guess there were enough drunk people sharing the space that we all kind of merged into one large cheering group somewhere between slices #2 and #3. Slice #3 took twice as long as #1 and #2, combined. I remember starting to sweat and feeling flush and dizzy, but I didn't stop. People were chanting my name, there was a buzz in the air I'd never felt before, I couldn't stop, not now, not ever!

The adrenaline was enough to get me through slice #3 (with cheers from the crowd) and to the start of #4, but my body was done at that point. I slowly and reluctantly nibbled my way through 1/2 of the fourth slice and then gave up.

I got cocky, letting my time in the limelight misguide me. I flew too close to the sun and got burned. I'm pretty sure I had a pretty rough time later that night, but can't remember anything after leaving Koronet.",nyc

durgadurgadurg,"Yes, for primitive camping, you can just rock up, hike in, and put up the tent. Some parks and forests have lean-tos and primitive camp sites already marked out for back packers. Those are first come first serve. Check out your park online before you go in case it's some wild life preserve or other exception that prohibits camping.  Always remember to leave no trace and take everything with you when you hike out. 

Camp grounds easily accessible from a parking lot will usually need a reservation, but they're probably closed anyways (state/county run campgrounds have probably been closed since early fall.)",nyc

imjustakitten,"We had to send a lot of COVID positive patients home if we couldn't actively do anything for them. Basically, they go home until they really can't breathe on their own, but up until that point, we might have been able to prevent them from deteriorating to the point of no return. The beds in the ER filled up with those intubated or on respiratory assistance but can't go into ICU due to lack of beds or providers, so the nursing ratio becomes really unsafe. Idk what the worst numbers were, but at one point our ER nurses were taking care of 10 patients when they usually have ~4, but normal ICU care for intubated patients is 2 patients per nurse. What good is it to have a closet or a hallway in the hospital if you couldn't even get 20% of the care you needed when you are dying?",nyc

The ""blended remote"" teachers are ALL subs, the majority of whom are not licensed at all. They basically sit in the meet for the 45 minutes and tell the kids, ""Do whatever work your teacher has posted for today. If you need any help, let me know."" The kids don't ask for help because they know that the sub generally does not know whatever content area they are ""teaching"". Barely any learning goes on when these kids are at home.

Blended learning SUCKS, plain and simple. It's a waste of time. Is remote learning perfect? No, it's no substitute for the real thing. But at least you have a REAL teacher 5 days a week and you might actually learn something every day.",nyc

bot90210,"Ok what you need to do is obviously have the tax returns. Luckily landlords are desperate right now so you can use that to your advantage. The landlord is going to wonder why your income jumped so you will need to explain this. The landlord will wonder how steady your cashflow is. If you have a boost this year but it is not steady into next year then I would not expect to get the apartment. But if you can show business income for the previous 2-3 months and show that it is steady and explain why it went up then you should be fine. Some landlords would want a letter from your accountant to serve as an ""employment letter"" since you can write whatever nonsense you want and say you earn X amount this basically certifies the tax returns you are providing.

In summary, I wouldnt' jump through too many hoops right now because landlords are extremely desperate there is no need. Just be upfront and make sure you qualify for the apartment with the 40x requirement based off your actual income. If you are simply projecting income that doesn't fly.

Also having a guarantor either a real person or one of the guarantor companies will solve all of your problems. Personally that's the route I would go to guarantee I get the apartment.",nyc

I began looking at new places and as soon as I found one I liked I made a low-ball offer to see what happens.

I did not get attached to any one apartment I just made a bunch of offers to apartments I liked to see what the market was like. I did not negotiate for concessions but instead negotiated actual rent and for two years.

A few places refused to negotiate and barely lowered rent from their 2018 standards so I ignored those. A few others negotiated to my low-ball offer.

I found a place much lower, 2 bed at 1700 and accepted the offer.

My current landlord then offered to stay at $2000 about a month later which I refused. Now the place will remain open for a while.

So find places you like and make low-ball offer to them. Check the listings around to see how low rents can go.

WiF1,"My suggestion is that people should only get tested if they have a reasonable suspicion (e.g. someone did indeed attend a block party) that they're infected. People who are in regular contact with a whole bunch of people (e.g. waiters, grocery stores workers, etc.) should probably get tested regularly. My suggestion is **not** that people should _always_ avoid getting tested.

I stand by my example of couch potatoes who never see people generally shouldn't bother getting tested. Each test costs _someone_ (or more realistically, some government/insurer) ~$100 which is actually non-trivial. To do some napkin math, there's something like 330 million people in the US currently. If every person gets tested once per month for a year, that'd be 3.96 billion tests. If each of those tests costs $100, the cost would be $396 billion. If each of those tests costs $10, that'd be $39.6 billion. Both are enormous numbers.

Mr_CIean,"&gt;COVID-19 has pushed organizations into an unprecedented and unplanned experiment in remote and hybrid work. Even when the experiment ends, following mass deployment of a vaccine or treatment, the key findings of this experiment will endure. Hybrid work is here to stay.

[That's the conclusion of this BCG article.](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/managing-remote-work-and-optimizing-hybrid-working-models)

I think it's very easy to come to the conclusion that we will see much more hybrid work than pure remote work, if you look at the history of remote work, the surveys on collaborative work productivity, and the actions of corporations (buying real estate and many only mildly committing to full WFH outside of a few notable exceptions).

Of course certain roles might shift more than others - some you have to go into the office all the time. Coders were already largely able to remotely work and some was outsourced to places like India. More roles are conducive to hybrid than full remote though.",nyc

yunqifunki,"&gt;	Because u/nypd employees are too busy jerking each other off to QAnon, it’s somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it’s not okay for us to confront you.


It’s literally not enforceable. Not on the subway. Especially not as a general policy. 

Millions live in NY and ride the subway every day. 427 stations in the system with multiple entrances. 

There are approximately 1200 cops patrolling the entire system (+ some special plainclothes teams intended for more serious crimes I assume). 

Somebody can come in with a mask then take it off while on the subway. People pull down their masks for a few seconds or minutes. 

They’ve been instructed to offer a free mask before issuing any fines. So, once again, someone could put on the mask and take it off later. 

All of these facts don’t include the conservation about prioritization. Focusing our time on enforcing a mask mandate is a waste of time (imo). Especially when we’ve seen more violent crimes committed on the subway in recent months (stabbings, pushing onto tracks, etc.). 

Furthermore, we’ve only discussed the subway so far. Mask mandates are even more difficult (if possible at all) to enforce outdoors. We’ve made outdoor dining permanent, which requires people to remove their masks. Someone could walk down the street or sit in a park while “eating a bag of chips” for two hours to avoid wearing a mask. Just have a bottle of water with them and say their mask is down because they were just drinking water. So many other reasonable excuses. 

Finally, based on your sentiment and generalizations towards the cops in this post, I’m going to go out on a limb and say you’re in favor of defunding the cops (correct me if I’m wrong). If so, more prioritization will be needed. Violent crimes and emergencies will be far more important than mask adherence. Once again, ~1200 for a system with 427 stations (some are very large like TS and GC) and ~5,000,000 people a day. Fining every individual who doesn’t wear a mask is just impractical. 

&gt;	it’s somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it’s not okay for us to confront you.

Who are you referring to? The cops who don’t wear masks or the riders? It sounds like your talking about the riders. 

If so, nothing is stopping you from confronting them lol. That’s not a smart decision but it’s a decision you are allowed to make. People tell you not to confront them because the absolute best case scenario is they’ll ignore you or tell you to fuck off. But go ahead. If you’re not right next to them, though, it will come off as though you’re trying to start trouble. I’m not advocating for their actions, I’m just stating what it’d look like from an outsiders perspective.",nyc

It's not that the USPS needs to pre-fund pensions, all companie have to. It's also not that it has to fund it's retiree medical benefit, all companies have to. The issue with the PAEA is that unlike every other companies in existence, 1/ USPS has no ability to cancel it's retiree medical benefits (only Congress can), and 2/ the USPS was made to jump start that fund over a 10 years period (which is absurdly short). No private carrier would survive that, most of them already operate on absurdly tight margins. The USPS was made to pour billions into funding absurd requirements for a decade instead of being able to invest in efficiencies.

There’s some real white guilt shit and to be honest I don’t want anything to do with it. It’s my fault for not realizing that this block has gentrification tensions.

gregathon_1,"Well, as far as freedom of speech goes, Democrats have advocated for censorship on multiple different occasions. For instance, Joe Biden wants to get rid of Section 230, which is key to freedom of speech on the Internet.

[https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/](https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/)

Freedom of religion is not about ""protecting people from the religions of others,"" it's about preventing governments from practicing religion and criminalizing others from practicing religion. A government cannot establish a religion, it must be secular. It's typically defined as: ""a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.""

Thus, it is in the free speech of people to practice (within their own private company) discriminatory practices. By virtue of the free market, businesses that practice discriminatory policies would not get lots of customers and would have to adjust in order to survive as a business. This is all included in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Higher taxes aren't doing anything when we're already trillions of dollars in debt. Instead of just collecting more taxpayer money, we should reinvest this into good healthcare, ending poverty and hunger. We have a lot more money than you think. Also, higher taxes = worse economy and worse economy = more unemployment and more unemployment = more poverty and hunger. Lower taxes would better help ameliorate poverty and hunger in this country.

That list is not at all accurate for the reasons I outline in my previous comment. Scandinavia is ranked on the Economic Freedom Index to actually be higher than the U.S. meaning that it is, in fact, more capitalist. Unless you think the U.S. is socialist, then Scandinavia and all of Western Europe is very much capitalist. You're confusing capitalism + a few regulations to make sure it's kept in check and socialism, which is when everything is owned by the government/people. That's a completely different system, and more in line with Zimbabwe/Venezuela/Yugoslavia type systems.

Also, my last paragraph did not include any ad hominems. I merely claimed that Trump has not turned America into an authoritarian oligarchy, as you claim he did and wants to. His system is just as liberal and democratic, as any other president (with the exception of Nixon and Bush). I'm also not ""alt-right."" I'm not sure why you get this impression, as I would consider myself to be a centrist, possibly leaning towards the left. I'm pro-choice, pro-free healthcare, pro-immigration, anti-death penalty, pro-same sex marriage, and anti-war on terrorism.",nyc

NeilPunhandlerHarris,"I’d argue that he was a bit of a disappointment of a president. It was a good time in history to reverse the damage done by the iraq war and the financial crisis and set up protections against that happening again. That never happened. The ACA barely got passed and it’s routinely on the chopping block, it was also a middle ground and clearly should’ve been more progressive if it was going to try and be repealed by any right wing candidate. He also expanded the surveillance state resulting in Snowden being a whistleblower who Obama condemned as a traitor. The police aggression issues were a hotbed issue toward the end of his presidency and the changes made did almost nothing to solve the problem. He had a tremendous chance to swing decades of American history for the better and didn’t seize the opportunity IMO",nyc

This type of is not only costing millions in economic destruction but people are fucking dying.

“BuT tHe CoNsTiTuTiOn”

......

Well... maybe, but the prosecutors on this case can still throw the fucking kitchen sink at these pieces of shit and let the judge decide. Not sure why they are pitching weak ass softballs with misdemeanors.

This isn’t the GOVERNMENT infringing on your rights when they tell people to wear fucking MASKS and don’t get to close to each other. The 90-98% of the PEOPLE in NYC want you to wear a mask, social distance, and not be a fuck head. The government is the only agent who can, on our behalf, enforce this standard. So this is not the government infringing on your rights forcing you to behave in a way that doesn’t harm society- It’s the rest of us people.

* **Brenan Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who’ve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected $9 billion budget shortfall.**
* **Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving companies and tech start-ups tracking smartphones all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year.**
* **For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined.**

Like many before him, [Brenan Hefner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenanhefner/) arrived in New York 20 years ago in search of a career on Wall Street.

His journey will sound familiar to those drawn to the nation’s financial capital. Hefner got a job at an asset management firm in Manhattan, found love and career success, and eventually moved to Pelham, an upscale town in Westchester, to start a family.

He would still be there if it wasn’t for the coronavirus pandemic. When Hefner, co-founder of a research platform called [Analyst Hub](https://www.analysthub.com/), sold his house this summer to a couple from London, he wondered if it made sense to look beyond the surrounding neighborhoods for a new home. He ended up moving his family to Dallas last month.

Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who’ve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected [$9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-faces-toughest-fiscal-crisis-since-the-1970s-11598205600) budget shortfall. While the city is no longer the national virus hotspot it was earlier this year, those leaving cite anxiety over the region’s economy and quality of life and a conviction that higher taxes are coming. Last month, business leaders [publicly upbraided](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/nyregion/de-blasio-economy-coronavirus.html) Mayor Bill De Blasio for “deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs.”

By forcing the mass adoption of remote work and crimping many of the advantages of urban life, the pandemic has turbocharged migration from high cost, high-density places to lower-cost states including Texas, Florida and Nevada. Nearly half of New Yorkers earning more than $100,000 a year said they considered leaving the city recently, with cost of living being the top factor, according to a Manhattan Institute [survey](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/survey-nyc-high-income-earners-future-work-and-quality-life).

“The cost of living down here is significantly less,” Hefner said by phone from his new home. “There’s no state income tax. I’m not riding mass transit during the middle of a global pandemic to get to a subway to live in a [WeWork](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/wework-says-it-will-file-request-to-withdraw-its-ipo-prospectus-after-roadshow-management-turmoil.html) or something.”

For Brenan, the pandemic showed that for those in financial services, the gravitational pull of New York still exists, but is far weaker. He says he is about as effective operating his business over Slack and Zoom, and plans on flying to New York monthly for client meetings. His company, founded in 2018, helps star Wall Street analysts leave big banks to form independent research shops.

“I’m just not sure it’s a requirement to be in the city anymore,” Hefner said. “That doesn’t mean that I don’t love the city, I do. It’s an amazing place, but as far as a family of five, I’m not sure if it’s the right place for us at this time.”

## ‘Everybody’s leaving’

Even within his 19-person start-up, Brenan has company. [Caroline Goodson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-goodson-33917927/), his director of corporate access and sales, left Manhattan after a homeless encampment popped up outside her apartment building. She also moved to Dallas.

His co-founder [Michael Kronenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-kronenberg-4a352815/), who owns a downtown Manhattan apartment, has spent most of the pandemic outside of New York, renting a succession of houses in places including Scottsdale, Arizona; Vail, Colorado and Sullivan’s Island, South Carolina. For senior finance professionals not chained to a trading floor, moving to lower-tax states has never been more appealing, he said.

“Everybody I know is leaving,” Kronenberg said. “It’s not just New Yorkers. My partners, long-time clients and investors of mine that live in Connecticut or New Jersey, they are used to commuting in to the city. They’re never going to commute in five days a week ever again.”

The coronavirus pandemic has caused the worst global economic crisis in living memory and taken 230,000 American lives so far, with New York City claiming one-tenth that grim figure. Downtown and midtown business districts are still a shadow of their former selves, depriving local businesses and the city of much needed revenue. A [record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/30/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage) daily case count in the U.S. and surges in Europe have New Yorkers bracing for a tough winter.

But since moving trucks began clogging city streets this summer, New Yorkers have been incensed by the idea that the place De Blasio refers to as the “greatest city in the world” is on the cusp of a multi-year decline. An ex-hedge fund manager’s LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/) that declared “NYC is Dead Forever” prompted a withering [response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/opinion/jerry-seinfeld-new-york-coronavirus.html) from Jerry Seinfeld.

Many of those who remain say the city is more livable than before, with streets closed off to car traffic and restaurants taking up more outdoor space. Of course, the city has bounced back from every calamity in its history, from the 1918 Spanish flu to the suburban flight of the 1970s, the terror attacks of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.",nyc
brooklynlad,"Part 2 of 2:

## Falling rents

But it’s hard to deny the signs of pain ahead. Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving [companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/new-yorkers-flee-for-florida-and-texas-as-mobility-surges) and tech start-ups tracking [smartphones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/upshot/who-left-new-york-coronavirus.html) all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year. More than 246,000 New Yorkers filed a change-of-address [request](https://abc7ny.com/7-on-your-side-investigates-pandemic-exodus-leaving-nyc-fleeing-new-york-city/6386411/) to zip codes outside the city since March, almost double the year-earlier period, for instance.

That’s reduced demand for Manhattan apartments, where median monthly rents [fell](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-real-estate.html) 7.8% to $2,990 in the third quarter, part of a city-wide decline not seen since 2010, according to StreetEasy.

To be sure, the New York area’s suburbs have been the primary beneficiary of the exodus: Home sales in Westchester jumped 112% in July, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. Sales in Greenwich, Connecticut just had the strongest [quarter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/greenwich-home-purchases-soar-to-a-decade-high-on-nyc-exodus) in more than a decade.

For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined. Meanwhile, states including Florida, Texas and Nevada don’t tax wages. The more people make, the greater the incentive there is to leave, and the difference could easily mean hundreds of thousands more dollars in after-tax pay.

That’s a trade that some Wall Street titans have already made. Hedge fund billionaire [Paul Singer](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/09/13/paul-singer-on-the-markets.html) is moving the headquarters of Elliott Management to Florida from midtown Manhattan, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-21/singer-s-41-billion-hedge-fund-moving-headquarters-to-florida) this month. His move follows that of another billionaire, famed corporate raider Carl Icahn, who made the switch [last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/carl-icahn-is-said-to-be-heading-to-florida-for-lower-tax-rates) to avoid New York taxes.

## Busiest in 40 years

“My concern isn’t that they’re leaving, it’s that they’re taking their businesses with them,” said [Mark Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-klein-370901ba/), a New York-based tax attorney and chairman of Hodgson Russ. The flight of business owners is worrying for those remaining in the city, he said.

Still, it has kept him busy. Klein says he has ten times more clients now than pre-pandemic, helping advise people who make more than $800,000 a year move to low-tax states, often bringing their businesses along. Besides hedge funds, Klein said that a spectrum of professional services operators are leaving, including public relations and accounting firms.

“I’ve never been as inundated with people leaving New York and Connecticut, any of these high-tax states, in my 40 years of doing this,” he said. “Once Covid hit, with the recognition that people can work from any location, the floodgates opened.”

The stakes are higher in an election year, with many in finance convinced that higher taxes are coming if [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/) wins and Democrats take the Senate. Within [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GS), multiple traders have told me they are voting for Biden “against their own financial interests” because of his stated plan to raise taxes on those earning more than $400,000 – an easy threshold to exceed on Wall Street.

And to a person, high-earners I spoke with said that the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions from President Trump’s 2018 overhaul hurt them personally and believe that local governments are going to seek more money from them in coming years.

Leavers aren’t limited to hedge fund traders and portfolio managers; New York is also home to a growing ecosystem of fintech firms.

When fintech CEO [Paraag Sarva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psarva/) bought a weekend home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania last year, he figured he’d probably rent it out most of the time. But months into the pandemic, after it became clear that full-time, in-person schooling in New York was unlikely for his small children, he made it his permanent residence.

His new neighborhood, studded with horse farms and multi-acre estates, is vastly different from his old home by the expressway in Brooklyn. Two other families from New York have moved in recently, he said, and they have brought their businesses.

His start-up, [Rhino](https://www.sayrhino.com/), which replaces renters’ security deposits with a small recurring fee, is still based in Manhattan. But Sarva rarely returns; he has managed the firm’s [explosive growth](https://medium.com/@psarva/the-new-normal-what-covid-19-is-teaching-our-team-53adb0abc57f) from afar. During the summer, the company doubled its employee count to 90 and raised $14 million in additional capital.

While schooling and quality of life were the main drivers of his move, the lifelong New Yorker wasn’t going to “leave money on the table.” His taxes are 10% lower in Pennsylvania, he figures.

“Once we made the decision, we did consult our tax and legal advisors on what exactly that would mean,” Sarva said. “I am officially a Pennsylvania resident. I voted here, registered my car here, have a Pennsylvania driver’s license. I’ve moved out of my former home and have no intention of returning.”

## ‘Less boring’

In some finance circles, even people who may not have permanently uprooted their families like Hefner or Sarva are pushing for a tax break. They are typically city dwellers who moved full time to their second homes once the pandemic struck.

“There are a bunch of people I know trying to get out of the NYC tax, they’re living in the Hamptons, Westchester, Connecticut or New Jersey,” said a managing director at a major global investment bank. Another colleague who worked mostly in New York moved her residence to Delaware, he said. He declined to be identified speaking frankly about taxes.

The executive owns condos in Manhattan and houses in Sag Harbor, but has spent most of the pandemic in New Jersey. After a three-hour meeting with his tax consultant, he plans on filing taxes as a Jersey resident to avoid New York’s 3.9% city tax. He and his friends are [risking an audit](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/09/14/new-york-city-income-tax-coronavirus-squawk-box.html), which can happen three years after he files his 2020 taxes.

In the meantime, he’s worried that his expensive Manhattan properties will lose as much as 40% in value in the coming years.

“Nobody’s gonna feel sorry for me,” he said. “The good news is, maybe the city will get less boring.”",nyc

Top that off with actual religious rules about not badmouthing others (even/especially when the bad news is true) and rumors about specific people don't always go into the right hands.

dietoreos,"No, VAS plates do not allow you to run any lights. They don’t give any privileges what so ever. If you are an ambulance service you have to register with the state DOH all of your emergency response vehicles. They give you a orange sticker to put in the window denoting EMS emergency vehicle status, but this also makes said vehicle subject to “part 800” DOH inspections. There is a state DOH EMS authority that can literally pull over ambulances/response vehicles and inspect them/put them out of service in case of violations.

EMS can have unmarked cars but it’s usually reserved for on call supervisors who don’t want to advertise to the whole world they are in a response vehicle while going about their day and the state really doesn’t like to approve them. Most agencies only have a handful of unmarked cars for chief level and above supervisors. They are required to meet minimum equipment standards and can be inspected at an time.

The Long Island counties do allow for green “courtesy lights” for the volunteers in their personal cars, but they can only be used when one is formally dispatched to an assignment and I believe they don’t allow you to run red lights or speed. A buddy of mine who is the chief of a volly in Long Island has had to pick up more than one over eager young EMT after the troopers towed their car for misusing courtesy lights.

[https://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/nyc/](https://www.labor.ny.gov/stats/nyc/)

A lot of businesses have work at home policies which were enacted in mid-March. My company give employees the option to return to the office in July. I am actually one of the few in my company to go back to the office to work 3 days a week. The office is more or less empty; I generally see maybe 4 other people on my floor which can accommodate over 80 people. They might come in once a week. I am the only person on my small team of 5 people who goes into the office and I have not seen anyone else from my section of the floor come into work so far. I know one of them is very scared to comeback into the office and prefers to work at home indefinitely. 

A lot of little businesses in roughly mid-town Manhattan (south of Grand Central Station) are closed, though some are still open but at reduced capacities. These types of businesses are general goods stores, restaurants / eateries, coffee shops, bars, news stands, dry cleaners, etc... They depend on foot traffic coming from people working in nearby offices. With a lot of people working at home many of these types of businesses have simple closed. Time Square is basically dead. Theaters are closed.

People have been returning to work in general. Back in July when I started to go back into the there might have been up to 6 other people in the train / subway cars I have been riding in. Now trains / subway cars are probably around 40% full at certain times.... I am guessing that is 30 to 35 people.

Regarding apartments... well, vacancies are up according to the article below, in August 2020 there were 15,000 empty apartments which is a record high. People have been leaving NYC because I guess fear of COVID-19, but also due to riots by Black Lives Matters (BLM) and also Antifa. You can do a Google search for those two organizations; Antifa.

Naturally the riots leads to increased crime, and there is a movement to de-fund the police.

dietoreos,"Oh my god, just the way you talk about this shows how simplistic your take is. 

All of the covid official death numbers start in each state’s department of health. The New England journal of medicine does not have a independent way of collecting data. If the NYS DOH is not putting out the number of people who got infected in the nursing homes, who then died at the hospital, there is no other way to collect that information. The nursing homes and hospitals only reported to their state DOH, no one else. It is impossible for the number of people who died because of nursing home infection to be accurate in the currently released statistics. Every single serious person in healthcare believes this.

I work in healthcare in NYC. I treated scores of nursing home patients. I had 5x more people die in a 60 day period, then I had lost in my entire career up to that point.

You are delusional. You are willingly giving everyone else a pass because you don’t like Trump.

I don’t like him either, but Cuomo was the one in charge of the response in NYS. The feds mostly just provided material resources and guidance. But Cuomo is the one who made the decisions on how to deploy them.

Starcraftduder,"&gt; ""Small"" here doesn't just refer size of the population, but the size of the land (i.e. the distribution of the population), and also importantly, the amount of international travel. Even populous countries like Vietnam where it is (or used to be) relatively easy to travel abroad can do quite well at containment if the population is very concentrated, international travel is rare in the first place, and a concerted government effort happens before cases hit an inflection point. Unfortunately none of those things were true for the US.

You are way off the mark.

First of all, the reason multiple nations have all but eliminated coronavirus domestically is because of good policies and a non-psychopathic population. The reason nations like Taiwan, Vietnam, etc live essentially virus free lives is because of policies, not because of stuff you mentioned.

First of all, population density in a pandemic like this is usually a DISADVANTAGE. When this pandemic started, that's what everyone, including the experts were saying. In the case of SARS 20 years ago, people were catching SARS even in their homes because the virus leaked out through the plumbing system. People are living on top of each other and social distancing is near impossible because you can hardly open your window without sharing some virus particles with your neighbors above, next to, below, and across from you. Not to mention the leaks through plumbing.

And places like Taiwan is one of the major travel hubs in Asia. When flights get back to normal, do some searches for flights to various East Asian cities that aren't major international hubs. Chances are, a good amount of them will layover in Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, or Incheon. I know this because I've been working/traveling there for the better part of last decade.

Places like Taiwan gets exponentially more Chinese tourists per capita than America. Places like South Korea NEVER fully stopped Chinese TOURISTS from visiting their country. During the height of SK's initial outbreak, there were still Chinese tourists flying in. America has an incredible advantage in that almost all foreign visitors must enter the country through tiny choke points in our airports. Places like Vietnam, Mongolia, etc who all but eliminated the virus has to deal with porous land borders with China. If America didn't have the biggest moron leadership in its history, it would have easily controlled the pandemic. Hell, we ALMOST DID by simply banning travel from China. The mistake there is Trump banned travel as a cover for his trade war. If he had done it out of principle, he would have stopped travel from all countries that have the virus. Instead, the virus entered the US primarily through Europe.

&gt;There's no ""one simple trick"" that can stop this thing -- if there is, it isn't a mask -- and while a confluence of factors have worked in the favor of select countries, it isn't necessarily the case that the US can replicate them.

No offense, but this is the dumbest thing I hear about when it comes to this virus. Yes, the biggest step to take IS wearing masks. Like holy crap, only in the dumbest country on Earth is this even debatable. When this pandemic first started, nobody knew anything about it. How did some nations control it? They mandated and enforced mask wearing. Look at the ones closest to China. Why did almost all of China's neighbors do better than us? It's because they all wore masks. The ones who didn't (India) got screwed. I honestly hate the fact that in America, people need to waste energy on talking about masks. The discussion should be on how to get MORE masks and CHEAPER masks. Not whether we should wear them. Holy crap.",nyc

Sure, constructing market rate housing may ease the pressure on real estate prices. Ultra luxury high rises are not the answer is though, unless you're a billionaire.

dub-dub-dub,"""Small"" here doesn't just refer size of the population, but the size of the land (i.e. the distribution of the population), and also importantly, the amount of international travel. Even populous countries like Vietnam where it is (or used to be) relatively easy to travel abroad can do quite well at containment if the population is very concentrated, international travel is rare in the first place, and a concerted government effort happens before cases hit an inflection point. Unfortunately none of those things were true for the US.

If you like, you can look at Alaska. Despite sharing a border with Canada and closing its borders relatively late in the game, it's doing extremely favorably compared to the rest of the US with no ""mask culture"" to speak of.

dietoreos,"As others have said there is nuance to the categories of homeless persons.

I am a healthcare provider who’s primary patient population is the homeless. The two main cohorts are “sheltered” ( those that participate with the shelter system or other social services ) and the “unsheltered” ( those that live on the street for the bulk of their time )

These groups can be further broken down into smaller cohorts defined by what’s causing their homelessness.

Sheltered:

Economically distressed. ( Whole families, single mothers, single fathers )

Runaway youth ( lgbt bigotry, cultural displacement, abuse )

Domestic violence victims ( primarily single females/mothers )

Treated health condition ( Infectious disease, addiction, other mental/medical illness that limits the ability of someone to provide an income but the individual is compliant with treatment recommendations and is seeking support. )

Unsheltered:

Untreated severe mental illness.

Untreated or refractory addiction.

Behavioral disorders such as opposition defiant disorder being carried through to adulthood. 

( I personally place serious mental illness and behavioral disorders in related but nonetheless separate categories due to how they manifest when interacting with authority figures and healthcare providers. )

Ex-con males with no family and state imposed housing limitations ( sex offenders, violent felons, etc. )

Undocumented single adult male migrant workers.

Please note there is significant overlap between all of these categories in both the sheltered and unsheltered populations. but for the most part this is the general breakdown of how homelessness presents in NYC.

I’m absolutely despondent when it comes to the homelessness debate because there is no way to solve “homelessness” in general. We have to solve every individual’s problem that is causing the homelessness. For some it may be as simple as providing housing. For many it’s much more complicated and I know many patients who have housing provided by the city but still chose to live on the street.

Now as we all know it was eventually shut down as a public HS as it just literally went to shit.

What happened? How did it turn out to be such a bad school? The city kept extending the zoning boundaries for the school further and further south. Admitting more students from troublesome areas. Instead of focusing on improving the high schools in areas that needed revamping and restructuring the city ruined what was once a great high school.",nyc

Adavadava,"Oh I know there's been people gathering and walking. But their efficacy is questionable at best (my 2c). 

And yes, you are right that in theory SCOTUS is supposed to be that way. A lot of our government is supposed to theoretically function according to certain rules and norms. What actually happens isn't that, and I think for a lot of people it doesn't matter. If any form of government matters, it would be any executive position (the face, the most visible parts) followed by a distant 2nd being legislators followed by an even more distant 3rd in the judiciary. This plays out in every single election - voters turn out and money is spent way more on those three in that order, descending. 

Something like lifetime appointments is certainly something worth criticizng and debating, but youre talking to someone who thinks the entire theory of US government is hot garbage that needs to be thrown away, if I may be blunt. The constitution is frankly stupid. No reason to be poetic. its bad. its dumb. There are better ways to do liberal democracy, and there's no reason why we can't adapt new ideas (I'm being rhetorical, there are plenty of reasons, but theyre all steeped in cynicism and ""power is corrupt"")

My points mostly is that something like a scotus confirmation is something that simply does not register on most peoples radar. Most people want the classics - stable job and housing etc. Even if you draw a throughline from SCOTUS appointments to day-to-day action (which you certainly can) it wont matter because at the end of the day, SC Justices aren't telling local legislators and executives to do stuff. Frankly they dont evne tell local judges and prosecutors to do stuff. Thus, most people aren't going to be compelled to march on the street because Amy Coney Barrett is a new justice.",nyc

Why do lockdown skeptics insist on showing old information and assume it's still relevant today? 7 months ago, New York was at it's peak....the curve has clearly been flattened since then. I don't think I'm missing anything...Just look at New York's numbers TODAY, and compare it to states right now in the midwest that are experiencing massive spikes. New York was essentially one of the first states in the US to get it bad and have their spike. We've learned a lot since April. We had less resources available to us 7 months ago, we've learned more about the virus itself. Of course cases were going to spike. But the virus infected roughly 500,000 people in New York State. Nearly 20 million people live in New York State, 8 million of whom live in the city. The virus didn't ""run out of hosts"" like that article seems to imply. If New York hadn't taken the measures they did, many MANY more people would have gotten infected. Info from 7 months ago doesn't really represent where we are at today. Our worst point was over half a year ago. Just look at the data, it doesn't lie. Clearly the midwest states have failed to learn from New York's experience earlier this year. New York has every reason to be doing horrible right now, given the dense population in the New York City area, and the use of public transit, and yet despite all of that, the infection rate remains around 1%.

**What Will New York Real Estate Look Like Next Year?**

City planners, developers and local officials weigh in on how the pandemic could change the city’s housing markets, land use and policy.

The economic collapse fueled by the pandemic could reshape New York’s real estate industry, from public and affordable housing all the way to the overbuilt luxury condominium market.

**By** [**David W. Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-w-chen) **and** [**Stefanos Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/stefanos-chen)

One in five New York City tenants did not pay rent in September, by one estimate, and there is growing concern of “an eviction tsunami.”

As apartment vacancies climb, sale prices and [rents are falling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-rental-market.html), but nowhere near the magnitude needed to compensate for scarce affordable housing options.

And while the flight of affluent residents to the suburbs appears to be overstated, major companies are downsizing and fewer people are commuting, setting the stage for a new reckoning over personal and business priorities.

Real estate is everyone’s business in New York City. The industry generated nearly $32 billion in taxes last year, 53 percent of the city’s tax revenue, and it employed more than 275,000 people, according to the Real Estate Board of New York and labor statistics. An inveterate source of obsession, envy and frustration, real estate colors the aspirations and agendas of countless people, companies and policymakers.

So how the industry weathers an unparalleled economic collapse fueled by a global pandemic will reshape not just the chronically underfunded public housing system and the overbuilt luxury condominium market, but also virtually every aspect of urban life.

To assess what might happen in the next year or two, The New York Times interviewed nearly 50 people, including former senior city officials, real estate executives, affordable housing advocates, urban planners and brokers.

When will the real estate market recover, and what will it look like in terms of supply, demand, and prices?

Will New Yorkers be more open to development in their neighborhoods, or will they be even more resistant?

How will housing, transportation, retail and commercial real estate be affected in the broader New York region?

The outlook is daunting. Unemployment in New York City [is still 14 percent](https://labor.ny.gov/stats/pressreleases/pruistat.shtm), after hitting 20 percent in June and July. The hotel occupancy rate [is 39 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/nyc-tourism-coronavirus.html), down from 95 percent this time last year, according to the research firm STR. Roughly one-third of the city’s 240,000 small businesses [may never reopen](https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf), and [iconic retailers like Neiman Marcus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/realestate/how-will-hudson-yards-survive-the-pandemic.html) are closing.

Residential real estate sales plummeted [40 percent in July, and 57 percent in August](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-18-september-28-2020/), compared to 2019, according to the New York City Comptroller’s Office. Commercial sales were [down 28 and 43 percent in July and August, compared to last year](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-11-july-27-2020/).

Still, many experts predict that New York will eventually bounce back — as it always does, citing the eventual rebounds after the Great Recession, 9/11 and the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.

The Manhattan skyline, awash in vacant offices, as photographed from the observation deck at Rockefeller Center in August. Remote work has already had a profound effect on the real estate market.    

**What Will Happen to the Market?**

Rents and sale prices will continue to drop in the next year, significantly so in some areas, but likely not for the people who need relief most.

Rents in the New York metro area — including parts of New Jersey and White Plains — are projected to drop 7.7 to 11.3 percent by the middle of next year, from the first quarter of 2020, according to Andrew Rybczynski, a managing consultant with CoStar Advisory Services, a commercial real estate data provider.

After the 2008 recession, rents fell nearly 10 percent in Manhattan because of high unemployment and rising vacancies, said Nancy Wu, an economist with the listing website StreetEasy.

The median rental price in Manhattan, including concessions, was $3,036 a month in September, according to the brokerage Douglas Elliman. That is an 11 percent drop from the same period a year ago, but still far beyond the means of most New Yorkers. Citywide, the median rent last year was $1,467 a month, according to the New York University Furman Center.

Rents will continue to drop citywide, in the absence of a vaccine, Ms. Wu said, but that trend masks affordability problems in several neighborhoods hit hard by the coronavirus.

In [an analysis](https://streeteasy.com/blog/covid-19-nyc-rents/) of neighborhoods with the lowest rates of infection — affluent neighborhoods like Battery Park City and SoHo in Manhattan — rents dropped 1.9 percent from February to July, largely because of rising vacancies. In the hardest hit neighborhoods — including East Elmhurst in Queens and Fordham in the Bronx — rents have actually increased 0.3 percent in the same period, and a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic renters, many in the service industries, have shouldered that burden.

“New York has been a tale of two cities — not just in terms of the pandemic, which is known, but also with rent affordability,” Ms. Wu said, noting the dearth of options on the lower end of the market.

In sales, the boroughs beyond Manhattan are expected to recover sooner, because they are relatively less expensive, and proximity to Midtown is no longer a top priority. In August, Brooklyn [exceeded the pace of sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/realestate/brooklyn-real-estate-sales.html) recorded the same time last year, and Queens is on a similar but slower trajectory, according to StreetEasy.

Discounts of under 10 percent are widespread, but prices have yet to plummet, except in the ultraluxury tier. Buyers waiting for fire sale prices may be disappointed, because the market was already three years into a price correction before Covid-19, Ms. Wu said.

It is less clear what will happen in the saturated new-development market. Out of more than 20,000 condo units citywide that have come to market since 2018, nearly 60 percent remain unsold, said Kael Goodman, the chief executive of Marketproof, a real estate data company. That represents $33 billion of unsold apartments, and about 2,000 of those units have not yet even begun sales.

So far, the glut of new luxury inventory has not resulted in many distressed sales, in which units may be sold in bulk to investors at deep discounts. To avoid foreclosure, some scenarios could involve converting condos to rentals, or restructuring loan obligations. Industry observers expect to see more of these actions in the months to come, as developers run out of options to satisfy lenders.

“It’s the ‘Road Runner’ dynamite scenario: The fuse is burning, but it hasn’t blown,” Mr. Goodman said. “Whichever way things break, there will be buildings that will have to be traded.”

Zohran Mamdani, a housing counselor and democratic socialist, unseated the incumbent assemblywoman, Aravella Simotas of Queens, in July, and said that his election and that of other progressives would “change the nature of the Assembly.”",nyc

**What Happens to Real Estate’s Political Clout?**

In recent years, the real estate industry’s clout [has waned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/nyregion/real-estate-industry-nyc.html) as local legislators have leaned increasingly to the left, and campaign contributions from the Real Estate Board of New York [have shriveled](https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/9565-campaign-donations-real-estate-lobby-drop-dramatically-democrats-decline-new-york). In July, [progressive challengers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/progressive-primaries-ny-legislature.html), like Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a housing counselor, toppled incumbents viewed as too moderate.

City and state legislators are mulling an apartment vacancy tax and other measures to discourage speculative investment, while opponents warn of a “death spiral,” in which over-taxation could scare away the wealthy. The highest-earning [1 percent of New York City residents](https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/nycs-high-income-tax-habit/) generated 43 percent of city income taxes and 51 percent of state income taxes collected from individuals living in the city as of 2016, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank.

But more than any statistic or legislation, the most consequential factor for real estate is what will happen on June 22, 2021.

That is the date of New York City’s next primary election, and it will be the most consequential since 2013, when Bill de Blasio, bolstered by his [“tale of two cities” campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/nyregion/de-blasio-shifts-away-from-his-re-election-message-of-one-city.html), swept into office. Now, with term limits forcing out a deeply unpopular Mayor de Blasio, along with most of the City Council, [a wide-open battle for the city’s leadership](https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9596-who-is-running-for-what-office-2021-new-york-city-elections-mayor-city-council) is underway. And real estate interests say the stakes have never been higher.

The city’s next mayor will need to address urgent land use and housing issues that have dogged the current administration even in a time of prosperity and freewheeling spending. A [$9 billion budget shortfall looms.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/nyregion/nyc-budget-coronavirus.html)

Depending on what happens in the presidential election, it is too early to gauge whether voters will opt for, say, a technocrat like former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg or a rising progressive like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. One presumed favorite, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, [has already bowed out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/nyregion/corey-johnson-mayor-nyc.html), highlighting the unpredictable nature of the race.

“What these two crises have laid bare is that this extraordinarily wealthy city which was doing so well for one segment of the population was completely failing other segments of the population, including people we now call essential workers, and communities of color, generally,” said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a former city planning official who is now dean of the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. “Now how can we use this pause to think about the city that should be — a more equitable city?”

Some power brokers, like the developer Stephen M. Ross and Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, are [already plotting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/nyregion/mayor-stephen-ross-daniel-doctoroff.html) how to best use their influence and money to elevate their preferred mayoral candidate.

“Just vote — vote in the Democratic primary,” said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of CBRE NY Tri-State, a commercial brokerage, during a Zoom panel organized by the [Partnership for New York City](https://pfnyc.org/research/a-call-for-action-and-collaboration/), an influential business group. “And get people to serve on the community boards who come from the world of business who understand the basic economics of the city.”

The city’s push to rezone SoHo, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for more affordable housing, could signal a shift in land use policy that had long favored redevelopment in less affluent communities of color.",nyc
J_smooth,"Continued...  


**What Will Happen to Big Projects?**

In light of the virus’s disastrous effects on the economy, some believed the path forward for several stalled megadevelopments would be cleared, because of their promise of new jobs and infrastructure.

Instead, opponents have grown more circumspect, and the De Blasio administration, in its waning days, could push for something critics have long demanded: rezoning in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods, not the communities of color that have often been the reluctant recipients of major redevelopment.

A large expansion of Brooklyn’s Industry City complex, which developers said would create 20,000 new jobs, [was quashed last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/industry-city-rezoning-nyc.html) by opponents who doubted that claim and said the project would hasten the displacement of the largely lower-income immigrant community nearby.

Also in September, the city backed out of a proposal to build up to 15 mixed-use towers on 28 acres in Long Island City, where Amazon previously failed to garner support for its New York campus, because of local concerns about gentrification and inadequate infrastructure.

The Justice for All Coalition, a community group opposed to the project, explained in a letter in July: “The proposed rezoning — for the purpose of building luxury residential and commercial mega towers — is exactly what this community does *not* need in the face of Covid and the urgent issues raised by Black Lives Matter.”

Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor under Mr. de Blasio, rejected that thinking.

“This is not the time to double down on the narrative that business is bad, that development is bad,” said Ms. Glen, who recently started a development firm, M Squared, which builds mixed-income housing in cities across the country. “We can’t play to the cheap seats of being against everything and everybody.”

But the disproportionate harm the virus has caused to Black and Hispanic residents in lower-income neighborhoods has emboldened another view, critics say: That the argument is not simply pro- or anti-development, but a matter of where the effort is placed, and for whom.

So the mayor’s decision this month [to back a rezoning in SoHo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/nyregion/soho-affordable-housing-development.html), one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for new affordable housing, is a significant moment, said Alex Fennell, the coordinator for the Racial Impact Study Coalition, a community advocacy group.

“It’s the first time the city has flat-out said, ‘We need to put more affordable housing in affluent, white neighborhoods,’ and that’s an important rhetorical shift,” Ms. Fennell said.

The proposal, which made scant mention of new housing when it was floated last year as a mostly commercial rezoning, is now seeking to allow about 3,200 new housing units to be built, including 800 below-market-rate apartments. The city has also signaled that a rezoning of Gowanus, a neighborhood in Brooklyn that is wealthier than several other neighborhoods eyed for redevelopment, is also a priority.

“There was an unspoken rule that you don’t rezone wealthy neighborhoods,” said Will Thomas, a board member of Open New York, a pro-housing group. While local opposition is already building, he said “SoHo is the first step in really showing that it’s politically possible.”

**What Happens to Affordable Housing?**

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which funds and maintains much of the city’s affordable housing stock, suffered a deep cut this summer, when the city agreed to decrease its capital funding by 40 percent over two years.

Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a policy and advocacy nonprofit, [estimated that ](http://thenyhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYHC-Policy-Brief-City-Budget-Cuts-10.6.2020.pdf)could translate into 21,000 fewer new and preserved affordable housing units and 34,000 fewer jobs, mostly in construction and related industries. (In a reversal, the city said Thursday that it would restore about half of the funding that had been scheduled to be cut.)

The cuts could delay or derail a number of once-assured projects. In Far Rockaway, Queens, an 11-building complex called Edgemere Commons with more than 2,000 units, all of which would be offered below market rate, was scheduled to receive city financing in December, but a backlog of stalled closings this summer means their project will likely be pushed back further.

“Now we’re in limbo,” said Daniel Moritz, a principal at Arker Companies, the developer, which planned to begin construction this year.

Millions of dollars in predevelopment costs like architectural plans, legal fees and engineers can overwhelm developers awaiting funding, said Ron Moelis, a co-founder of L+M Development Partners. His firm expected to close city financing in June on the first phase of Bronx Point, a mixed-use project in the South Bronx with 542 below-market-rate units expected to be completed by 2023. Now financing has been pushed back until at least December.

“At the exact moment in time when we as a city know that we should be doubling down, the city is pulling back,” said Barika Williams, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of housing organizations.

In a September survey representing about 85,000 apartments in New York, nearly 20 percent of tenants paid no rent, according to CHIP, a group that represents 4,000 landlords and managers of primarily rent-stabilized buildings.

And unemployment figures do not show the full scope of struggling renters, Ms. Williams said, because many who are out of work or are underemployed were paid in cash, and therefore not recorded by official counts. “We’re on the brink of an eviction tsunami,” she said.

Experimenting with new methods to create or preserve more affordable housing is crucial, said Rafael E. Cestero, a former housing commissioner who is now president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit housing and finance company. He urged elected officials to “channel more rental assistance” to the neediest New Yorkers.

“We can’t build our way out of the housing crisis,” he said.

T[he Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/be-my-neighbor) estimates that 500,000 new homes, including 100,000 in New York City, can be created — and at minimal cost — if state and local governments make it easier for basements, garages and attics to be converted into legal dwellings.

Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is running for mayor in 2021, is among those[ supporting plans to convert empty offices into housing](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/brooklyn-borough-prez-calls-converting-empty-offices-housing).

Meanwhile, the New York City Housing Authority, the landlord for one in 15 New Yorkers, is [exploring new ways](https://www.gothamgazette.com/open-government/130-opinion/9631-promising-new-plan-to-save-new-york-city-public-housing-nycha) to shore up funding. The agency needs $40 billion to fix issues including mold, lead abatement, and deferred maintenance in its 170,000 apartments across 2,252 buildings.

**Is Suburban Flight Just a Fad?**

The demise of cities is overstated, experts said, but lasting changes will become more apparent in the years to come, especially in the work force.

With many companies discouraging employees from coming into the office until mid-2021, Barry B. LePatner, a real estate lawyer, predicted that the daytime population in Manhattan’s business districts would get dramatically younger.

While older employees will be inclined to stay at home, particularly if they are juggling child care and education issues, younger ones won’t want to miss out on networking and socializing opportunities. “I believe this will be a generational thing,” he said.

A [report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/insights/covid-19/the-edge-volume-4/urban-to-suburban-the-growing-shift-to-the-suburbs-as-covid-19-changes-the-way-people-live) noted that the demand for suburban office space, “fueled largely by aging millennials,” was already outpacing urban cores.

More than 40 percent of U.S. bank executives also plan to reduce their office footprint to accommodate a partial work-from-home schedule, according to a survey by the consulting firm Accenture.

“The tether between work and home just got a lot longer,” said Jonathan Miller, a New York real estate appraiser. That shift is already increasing buyer demand in more affordable markets beyond the city center.

There are signs the suburban surge is slowing, as pent-up demand diminishes and prices there reach new highs, Mr. Miller said. While sales remain elevated, suburbs like Westchester and parts of Long Island saw contract activity peak in July.

But as the last seven months have reminded everyone, nothing in real estate is guaranteed.

Scott Rechler, the chief executive of RXR Realty and chairman of the Regional Plan Association, recalled a [Sept. 1990 Time magazine with a heartbroken “I Love New York” logo](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601900917,00.html) and the headline: “The Rotting of the Big Apple.” The cover story mentioned a poll in which 60 percent of New York City residents said that they wanted to leave.

“I keep this on my desk,” said Mr. Rechler, a former vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. “I want to remind myself that our prosperity isn’t guaranteed. We need to continually maintain the quality of life that drives people to continue to want to live and work in New York City.”

J_smooth,Sure thing. Just pasted it above in a few comments.,nyc
HappySausageDog,"&gt; We're not European are we?

In March and April our response was very much compared to the ""superior"" European response.  Europe is now handily beating America when comparing per capita vs. per capita case counts.

&gt;Canada is at 6.7. There is absolutely 0 reason our northern brothers are outdoing us besides political incompetence. 

There are many factors at play.  One of the most obvious is that America has performed about 60% more tests than Canada.  The Canadian daily average is creeping upwards and may increase at a more exponential rate at any time (much like what happened with Germany over the past two weeks).  Canada could also have better leadership as you pointed out, or a population more willing to social distance, etc.

&gt;They have the same issue of anti-masker idiots. Same culture of anti-authoritarianism. 

Lol.  Americans are wayyyyyyyyy more likely to rebuke authority, for better or worse.

&gt;Mexico is even lower, but that's probably just because of lower available tests.

Mexico has a significantly higher CFR than America does.  And the testing infrastructure is undoubtedly way worse.

My point about Europe is that even the countries that ""got it right"" are experiencing a massive wave of cases.  COVID is much harder to contain than anyone would like to admit, especially in countries and cultures that are more individualistic in nature.",nyc

Great- and grandfathers fought and bled for a better society, only to see it turn into a brutal dictatorship, senseless purges, and ultimately a failed economic and social system that ruined tens of millions of human lives. The idea of fraternity and equality is a beautiful one and I understand why youth fall for it. Unfortunately, in practice socialism leads to its literal opposite. China’s reforms, the case study of North vs South Korea and every place where communism was attempted point to this. Yes, Jews were one particularly oppressed group (though by far not the only one). Restricted or kept out of the best schools, jobs, and life opportunities (which were already meager under the Soviet regime). All this contributed to a massive “brain drain” later.",nyc

The neighborhood where they were originally housed, the neighborhood where they are currently staying, and the neighborhood into which they are (were?) going to be moved all have legitimate concerns about their behavior and the numerous incidents that have happened since they moved in. I have several friends and relatives in UWS and HK who have either witnessed or been the victim of illegal, threatening, and inappropriate behavior from the same group of men who were initially housed in the Washington Jefferson and are now staying at the Lucerne. Sticking hundreds of mentally ill, chemically addicted men in hotels in a family neighborhood and leaving them to their own devices isn’t going to solve anything. They weren’t even moved in until well after the bad Covid times in March and April, and the only reason they’re there is because the hotel owners are De Blasio donors and he wanted to kick them some funds while their hotels were sitting empty.

One thing I'd recommend is to not give a fuck about hurting their feelings.

I recall reading a study long time ago about women on trains.  When a creep sat next to them making them uncomfortable, in a mostly empty car, many women would continue to sit still because of how they thought moving away would be perceived.

Don't do that.  If you feel uncomfo in anyway, run away.  Be vigilant, don't walk around with headphones at night.  Don't stand around blind corners.  Always make space between you and everyone else.  Don't give a fuck about how moving away makes someone else feel.

The odds of you being randomly targeted in a shooting is practically zero. In a moving subway car, practice moving between train cars if you've never done that before.  As long as you make space, don't hesitate to run, and carry mace, you can give yourself a little more peace of mind that you're at least prepared.  Also mentally visualizing the types of situations that could arise and how you would deal with them helps prevent freezing up in the moment.

The way that these students are allowed to graduate all the way to college should tell you how much DOE give 2 shits about education. No other developed country will allow this to happen. To make matter worse, when math dept fight back saying ""we need to have standard, you cannot admit students that are not prepare for college,, you will have admin/politican/interest grp saying ""you cannot discriminate disadvantage students"". Yea, sure but how about improve your standard in grade school so that everyone graduates from high school actually, you know, have the knowledge of a high school kids.

And shes lucky I can teach her, but what about other less fortunate, what is their option? Right, there is no other option beside you will never learnt it.

At the end, the attack against Asian is just the easy way out for DOE because Asian, or I should say Chinese, never fight back and cant fight back. Until people starting to vote for people who sincerely care about education and believe in education will lead to a better future, the public school system will cont. to deteriorate. And unfortunately right now, I dont see this happening because the conversation is all about racial issue, when was the last time someone actually take about ""what is being taught""?; also, parents who can afford to send their kids to private school/ or move to better school district (eg. Long Island) will do show at a even faster way due to covid, so what is left are parents who are less affluence, which usually means nobody give a flying fuck as long as DOE ""looks progressive""",nyc

To me, this issue has nothing to do with identity or wanting to feel a certain way, but about basic safety and societal norms. For example, my cousin saw someone taking a shit on the sidewalk just outside her building in the West 70s a couple weeks ago. Another friend witnessed a robbery of the Starbucks at 81st and B’way, and an ex-coworker was followed and spit on by a homeless man in the West 70s.

Let’s start with the good news: The iPhone 12, [the first with 5G](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-event-iphone-12-expected-with-5g-capabilities-11602581403), is indeed the fastest 5G smartphone. The speeds will knock your masks off, as we say in 2020.

Now the bad news: To see those speeds, you need to move really, really slowly. After locating your carrier’s high-speed tower, stand right next to it, tap download, then freeze.

Despite being marketed as our technological savior, 5G—the next generation of cellular connectivity—is not a killer feature for the new iPhone 12 models. At least not in the U.S., not yet.

Don’t get me wrong: The cellular speeds *can* be insanely fast. In some tests, it’s up to [30 times faster than my home broadband](https://www.wsj.com/articles/5g-smartphones-could-crush-your-home-wi-fi-so-wheres-the-5g-11597670710). Just persuade the marketing department at MetLife Stadium—home of New York’s football teams and lots of [Verizon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ) [VZ **-0.09%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ?mod=chiclets)high-speed 5G antennas—to let you work on the field. (I did; see the video.) Just bring a power pack because 5G is a battery drain.

It’s best to think of 5G as an invisible feature—something that might one day come in handy. What makes this the best iPhone upgrade in years are a fabulous-to-hold design and substantial camera improvements.

Even those who bought iPhone 11 models last year might pine for these new ones. That said, I’ve aimed my testing and assessment at those who have been holding on to iPhones that are in the iPhone 8, X and XS families—that is, phones that are two or three years old by now. And yes, I’m also talking to readers I’ve heard from who are still clinging to a prehistoric iPhone 6 or 7.

If you’re due (or overdue) for an upgrade, opting for an iPhone 12 is a no-brainer. But to select which of the four models to get, it’s best to group them together:

**• iPhone 12 Mini ($699 and up) and iPhone 12 ($799 and up)**: [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL)’s [AAPL **1.32%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL?mod=chiclets)mainstream options have 5G, a new design and an improved wide camera. (They also have an ultrawide camera already found on earlier models.) The Mini has a 5.4-inch screen; the 12 has a 6.1-inch screen—otherwise, they’re identical. The Mini is available Nov. 13; the regular 12 is available Friday.

• **iPhone 12 Pro ($999 and up) and iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099 and up)**: These also have 5G but come with a slightly more premium design and a trio of cameras, including the new wide one. The iPhone 12 Pro has the same 6.1-inch screen as the iPhone 12. The Pro Max has a 6.7-inch screen, and a new telephoto camera. The Pro is available Friday; the Pro Max is available Nov. 13.

Unfortunately, because of the later ship date for the Mini and Pro Max, I was only able to test the standard 12 and 12 Pro. Meanwhile, here are your key considerations:

## Aluminum or Steel?

You know that feeling when you cut your hair and it feels dramatically different for a few days? That’s this year’s iPhone design change. The squared-off edges, the rounded corners, the clean glass back make this the best iPhone design in years. It reminds me of a slick, grown-up iPhone 5.

I actually prefer the 12’s lower-end aluminum for its lighter weight. Plus, the Pro’s flashy stainless-steel frame is a fingerprint magnet.

Speaking of magnets, Apple put some in the backside of these phones so you can snap on its new MagSafe accessories. It’s a neat trick—at least in theory. The $59 leather wallet attachment is great for storing credit cards. Except a few times, when I slid it into my jeans, the magnet detached and the wallet flew off.

Then there’s the $39 MagSafe charger. While it charged the dead iPhone 12 up to 50% in an hour—faster than a typical Qi-compatible wireless charger—Apple’s 20-watt wired charger took just 28 minutes. Plus, it has a short cord and the USB-C charging brick is sold separately. In an effort to save the earth, Apple removed that from the box. Don’t worry, I just reviewed [some better charging options here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-chargers-for-your-iphone-12-tablet-laptop-and-other-usb-c-devices-11602689252).

Though Apple makes other MagSafe cases, you may dare to make this your first caseless iPhone in recent memory. With a new “ceramic shield” over the glass and the new flat-edge design, Apple says it has four times the drop protection. The two phones slipped off a table onto cement and both withstood the fall without any nicks or dents.

##",nyc
Hefty_Umpire,"###### Two Cameras or Three?

The biggest decision between the 12 and 12 Pro comes down to a single camera.

Both have the same ultrawide cameras, which are great for capturing a whole scene. Both also have new wide cameras, updated with a wider aperture to let in 27% more light, according to Apple. In my low-light scene tests I could see a noticeable improvement over the iPhone 11, and big improvement over the iPhone X and iPhone 8.

So what’s different? The Pro adds a telephoto camera for taking closer shots. Whenever I would switch back from the 12 Pro to the 12, I missed the flexibility of being able to zoom into a scene without disrupting the action—a big thing for people with kids and pets.

The Pro also has a new lidar sensor, which [uses lasers to capture depth information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar). This will improve augmented-reality apps but also enables Night Portrait Mode, photos with that nice blur around the subject, even in low light. It did a nice job, but Portrait Mode still generally struggles with tough backgrounds.

###### G or Bust?

To really understand why you won’t see hair-on-fire speeds when you get a new iPhone 12, you first have to know the two types of 5G in the U.S.:

**Millimeter wave:** “I’m going to the Verizon 5G pole, honey. Be back soon!” This is my life when testing, because the fastest 5G doesn’t come to you. You go to it.

Named after its high radio frequencies, this is the blazing-fast connection Apple was bragging about during its event. In Jersey City, when testing Verizon’s Ultra Wide Band network, I saw download speeds as high as 3,000 megabits per second—3 gigabits! That is nuts!

Yet I could only do all that when standing right next to the tower. On my stoop, a block or so away, I can manage 800 Mbps. When I’m inside, I can only get 4G. This type of 5G can’t travel long distances, and obstacles like trees and walls can slow it down.

Verizon, [T-Mobile](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS) [TMUS **0.28%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS?mod=chiclets)and [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) [T **-0.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T?mod=chiclets)are putting up millimeter-wave cells in bigger cities and in public spots like stadiums and parks. That’s why I found myself at MetLife Stadium.

**Sub-6 5G:** Named for frequencies under 6 GHz, this isn’t as fast but provides far wider indoor and outdoor coverage. T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have substantial sub-6 footprints; Verizon just announced what it calls “Nationwide 5G.”

The issue? This sort of 5G isn’t always better than 4G. Throughout the week, I saw speeds ranging from 30 Mbps to 160 Mbps on both Verizon and T-Mobile’s sub-6 networks. Sometimes the iPhone 11 Pro’s Verizon 4G connection would get the same speeds.

I wasn’t able to test AT&amp;T with the new iPhones yet, but in past AT&amp;T tests with Android phones, its sub-6 network was spottier than T-Mobile’s.

I did, however, see much higher speeds with these iPhones than with any 5G Android phones I’ve tested so far.

Even when you’ve got the knock-your-masks-off speed, what can you do with it?

I downloaded the first two seasons of “Breaking Bad” (about 4 GB) in less than 3.5 minutes on [Netflix](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX) [NFLX **-1.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX?mod=chiclets)and Apple TV, respectively, and a 2GB game in 45 seconds from the App Store. Speedier than my home broadband network, that’s for sure. Yet it took 4 minutes to pull down just one episode on [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) [AMZN **0.31%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN?mod=chiclets)Prime Video. Download time can depend as much on the service you’re using as it does the speed of your network.

Plus, the iPhone 12 got uncomfortably warm during those downloads. To the point where I had to put it down.

While video streaming and FaceTime HD also looked clearer with 5G, its best use was sharing the connection with your laptop. You won’t get phone speeds, but working from my laptop from the stadium, I was able to hit 400 Mbps.

Of course, there’s a price for this. Literally. Verizon required me to upgrade to a top unlimited plan to get the UWB service.

And then there’s the battery drain. Downloading those episodes on Verizon’s UWB network used 15% of my battery. That’s why Apple included a Smart Data Mode. Enabled by default, it uses only that high-speed network if it detects you need it.

Most people won’t be on superfast 5G, and will find the battery life on these phones to be solid. They lasted a full day of fairly heavy use—though fell a bit shorter than the iPhone 11, which consistently leaves me with at least 15% before bed time.

A lot of this is just 5G growing pains. The carriers and Apple are betting that as the networks expand, and phones get into more hands, we’ll see apps and services we can’t yet imagine—just as 4G enabled the likes of Uber and Instagram.

If and when that happens, iPhone 12 owners will be ready. In the meantime, they’ll have a pretty great iPhone.",nyc

US News college ranking is probably the most prestigious academic rank **within** the US.
   
&gt;So it's based on output of academic papers. Not difficult to game. Even with just a cursory glance, any university ranking that places actual highly-regarded Chinese institutions like SJTU below middling ones like Huazhong or Southeast should be suspect.
   
how else do you propose to rank universities against each other? and FYI, SJTU is ranked 122 while Huazhong is ranked 209 globally. You are looking at individual subject rankings, not overall rankings. You can be the best school in the world, but have a shit engineering program. 
   
&gt;And what does a Big Mac in China rely on? Certainly not ingredients of the same origin as a Big Mac in the US.
   
which is why this proves china's higher PPP is not a lie.   
   
&gt;Because they are, in fact, allowed to offer their primary business- telecommunication services. If they weren't allowed to sell retail and business telecommunications services in the US, then you can make those claims.

Zach_the_Lizard,"UPenn actually tried to [analyze this a bit](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/10/12/covid-trade-offs-in-school-re-opening).

To give a sense of the cost of school closures:

&gt; By October 1, 2020, we project students in grades 1-12 had lost between $43,000 and $57,000, or 4 to 5 percent of their lifetime wage earnings.

Yes, multiple percentage points of future earnings lost. Implying lower government services and a weaker economy.

Their conclusion:

&gt; Based on September’s cost per COVID case, the threshold to close schools for October (using the high end of educational harm to children) is over 0.355 new expected infections per student.

Note that that is *new* cases. 

Remember: people were catching COVID while unemployed or retired. Some portion of students and teachers would have gotten sick even with 100% remote learning.

So to correctly interpret their analysis and put it into action, one must then ascertain what impact school reopening has had on infection rates.

A number of countries have had schools open and haven't really seen an increase resulting from them. 

Those results may not replicate here, but in theory our government has contract tracing info. They can tell us how things are going in school vs outside of school.

Note that their analysis also intentionally does not take into account things like lost childcare impacting parents, mental health, and a bunch of other things that would increase the cost of remote schooling.",nyc

Zach_the_Lizard,"&gt;If they can’t “catch up”

New knowledge is built on top of existing knowledge. And it requires work to maintain existing information.

It's well known that summer vacation has an impact on what students retain. Every school year we'd waste time going over existing concepts to recover what we lost before tackling new subjects.

Except now we've lost way more than just a summer vacation's worth of schooling. We have to not only catch up but learn at an even faster rate than before just to catch up to the last class.

From the [OECD paper about schooling and income loss](http://www.oecd.org/education/The-economic-impacts-of-coronavirus-covid-19-learning-losses.pdf):

&gt; Moreover, it is known from many studies (such as 
the analyses of skill development during the summer 
holidays described in the Annex A) that learning is a 
dynamic process that builds on prior learning, so that 
stagnation leads to growing deficits. Closed schools 
not only impart less new knowledge (Oreopoulos 
and Salvanes, 2011[3]), but also mean loss of already 
acquired skills on which further learning could build 
(Kuhfeld et al., 2020[4]).

Check out the studies they link to.",nyc

out-of-gum,"There are many reasons why having a car in the city is difficult.

1. The city will trash your car. Be it from pot holes or parallel parking disasters (hello love tap), the city is not kind to cars. This also means leasing is a no go.
2. Cars are expensive. Even buying used, if you have a decent car, you'll be looking at least $5k per year between depreciation, maintenance, gas, insurance, parking/tickets, repairs, oil changes, tire changes, side mirror replacements, etc. If you have an expensive car, first year depreciation alone can hit $20k+. Renting a car for the odd weekend that you need it is \~$200 per.
3. Time is also valuable and spending 40-50 hours per a year looking for parking is a lot of time that might be better spent, I don't know... sleeping? And waiting in your car for parking to become legal can be painful. Tickets are worse though. If you value your free time at $20 per hour it's not cheap.
4. Getting out of the city by car is hell, especially if you're going north and need to go anywhere near the GWB.

Cars are great, I would love to have one, but I've done the math and it's just not in the cards right now. When I'm not wfh I bike to work, I get my groceries locally, and when I need a car I rent one. I have an irresponsible friend that bankrupted herself on a Mercedes SUV. She leased it had to to do extensive repairs, got a ton of tickets, had a ton of stress with alternate side of the street parking. And she drove it for non parking reasons once or twice a month.

No. But but it's certainly better than public transit. Which tends to only be accessible to those rich enough to be able to afford to live in Manhattan or subway stops. 

Cars are cheap everywhere. And allow people to live farther away from transit and get more affordable housing. Those who live in the Bronx, deep Queens, and deep brooklyn, are not rich. Far from it. 

NYC natives are far more likely to own cars than transplants for example. The fetishism for public transit is a rich white transplant thing.

How many times have you been disturbed by an illegally off leash dog, and when you asked the owner to leash it, they responded ""he's trained so he doesn't need one""? That's the point of the dog treats, to prove they don't have as much control over their dogs as they think they do, or at least, to provide some incentive for the owners to obey the law.

There is actually quite a bit of wooded areas in Staten island, check the map.

There are no attractions in Staten Island (except for the Alice Austen House and the Conference House and Snug Harbor).

The South Shore is very safe, the North Shore is not safe.

The nicest areas of Staten Island are the three hills: Grymes, Todt, Lighthouse. Lighthouse is my favorite hill, Todt Hill has too much mafia (although the Staten Island Academy and the Richmond County Country Club are both in Todt Hill, so objectively it's probably the best neighborhood in Staten Island).

Most of those are found by people who travel to smaller towns all across the US to hunt, then bring them back to NYC (or LA) and sell them for a premium. 

There aren’t really any “secret” vintage stores, I’m sure google gave you all the good ones. But for quality vintage finds unfortunately NYC is probably the worst place in the US.

So, she doesn't exist in the database, even though we know her correct voter id, part of her name and address are now erroneously someone elses, but her birthday is correct. They said it must have been a data entry error. 

The real issue is that no one at the BoE seems to be able to fix it. In fact when we call they think we're confused and that her real name is this spliced together ""data entry error"". Honestly we've spent so long trying to fix this.... does anyone know someone at the BoE who has some authority or competency with their systems?

2. inquire abhout fees that you will be paying, off the top of my head:
 * application fees
 * move-in fee
 * refundable move-in deposit
 * move-out fee
 * refundable move-out deposit
 * someone recently mentioned in this sub about a move-in (and move-out) COVID19 disinfecting fee (to disinfect after the movers)

The vast majority of the people in those types of synagogues are what you’d imagine- wear suits, live a very conservative lifestyle and practice some kind of profession that fits their religious needs. But there’s often a few people around who are kind of disheveled, often not as observant and often kind of troubled people. It can be from a lot of things. They could’ve been raised Orthodox, lost religion and came back. Drugs or mental illness are often involved. Some are the Jewish equivalent of “born agains” grabbing onto something like Chabad for social support. These people may still have a cultural identity as “Orthodox” or “Chassidic” even though they don’t really fit per se.
