Thank you!",1
"Hello
(Looked for a similar post but nothing caught my eye)

It's the first year I'll spend Christmas in Boston due to COVID, and I was thinking of getting a real tree.
Is there someone that can suggest me about specific farms or other shops in Boston or north MA area?

I passed by Boston Christmas Tree in Allston this morning. They have just cut down tree (obviously, given the location) and when I touched one a large amount of green needles came out...

A ""cut your own tree"" farms would be the best I guess.",1
"My SO is one of those nerdy, intellectual-types that loves to ask a lot of questions about everything and will kind of close-up to someone if they're not willing to keep up with answering. They're really passionate about understanding how muscles work but also they're not keeping up with their own fitness! So I'd like to get them a physical trainer as a gift, but I think it's important that the trainer is someone who approaches training very scientifically and would be able to inspire my SO through knowledge (not just how-to's). Any recommendations for trainers in the Boston-area like this?",1
"I've been hearing that the Somerville Home Depot is going to be torn down to make space for more apartments/retail space. Haven't been able to find any information on it online, anyone have details?

"I’m looking to sell my condo in Boston. I’m struggling to understand how realtors can charge 5-6% in a market like Boston where most people search on realtor/Redfin/Zillow and MA law requires attorney representation. What value are they adding? As I see it there are a few options:

- Full price realtor (5-6%)
- Negotiate a full price realtor down (3-4%?)
- Redfin (~2-4% depending on buyers agent)
- FSBO (for sale by owner - no realtor)
- Other tech companies (Rex, etc, 1-4%)

Am I missing any options? What have others experiences been? Do I just suck it up and go with a full price realtor?",1

"Grad student living without a kitchen working late nights...I end up ordering out. Even small things, since the coffeeshops nearby me have either closed all the way down or have reduced hours. I just moved to Boston after living in New York all my life, and well-- Grubhub has stolen my food at least 3 times but probably more since I moved out here. And by the time I can even get a refund on it, it's already late, that was the one meal for the day, and I go to bed hungry. Heck, even when they actually do deliver, it's usually 30-40 minutes later than they said it would arrive.  Any recc's for other food delivery methods in the area? I'm dying out here! I literally just want a coffee...",1
I have been roaming around the city looking for a normally priced Christmas tree but every place I see has trees for $80-$100! Are there any good tree farms just outside that city that have nice trees for a good price? Preferably something in Metro west. Thanks!,1

"This happened many years ago.

At the time I lived just outside Coolidge Corner, partway up the hill, about 3 miles from Fenway Park.  It was after the leaves had mostly fallen off the trees.  I lived on the 2nd floor, so I could see over the buildings on the other side of the street.

It was dark, and I didn't have the lights on, I was just looking at the city.  Then I noticed a disk glowing in the sky, near Fenway.  It was like looking at a plate from above, not on edge.

It was moving slowly.  Eventually, it started changing, as it turned. &gt;! It was the Metlife Blimp (white, with Snoopy on the side).  It was exactly at my eye level, which is why it looked so funny.  Since it was dark, you couldn't see the people pod under the blimp.!&lt;

I heard some restaurants are closed for outdoor dining starting dec 1, so I’m not sure if that’s the case for all establishments. I don’t want to eat inside a place but I’d do take out, outdoor (weather permitting), or delivery. I’m also up for traveling by car to an Airbnb or something too. And I have a dog who Id like to include if possible. I know I’m fortunate to be wanting to plan a birthday given the current times, and I do not want to risk exposing anyone. 

Basically I’m looking for fun day trip or weekend ideas to make my birthday feel special while still staying safe. Dog friendly if possible.",1

I am looking at moving places within Boston and I was shown some of the Fenway apartments managed by Fineberg Management.

"Hi all,

I'll go ahead and apologize in advance for probably another redundant ""I'm moving to Boston please help"" post. I've looked through the subreddit on recent moving posts and while most were helpful, I still have some questions and am looking for advice in a few areas. 

Backstory is that I (28M) just accepted a job with one of the local hospitals located between Fenway and Mission Hill and will be looking to move from Memphis TN to Boston with my wife probably around early January. My wife will continue to work remotely with her currently employer as we move while she tries to find new employment locally. All in our household income will be around $142K annually. 

A lot of the questions I have center around moving, locating housing, and just daily living in Boston. 

1. The first question I have is around neighborhood suggestions. We would like to live somewhere relatively close to where I will be working which is around Dana-Farber, Brigham and Women's, Boston Children's campus. Being able to access work by either a bike ride or a quick hop on the T would be most ideal. Looking for a 2bd apartment somewhere between $2.5-3k/month.  Some of the neighborhoods that we've been looking at have been Fenway, Mission Hill, Allston, and Brookline. From what I can see I think our price range and what we're looking for is pretty spot on for the areas, but I guess I'm just looking to see if there is anyone here who can comment on the neighborhoods themselves. We like to live fairly social lives (as much as we can these days) so it would be nice to live in a fairly vibrant neighborhood.  
2. From what I've read online and the research I've done it seems like that it's pretty common to go through a broker when finding an apartment. Having lived my entire adult life primarily in the south, this isn't really something I'm accustomed with. I've heard some horror stories with some scummy brokers that look to take advantage of people and obviously I'd like to avoid this. Any advice in locating a trustworthy broker? I know that there are some apartment listings on craigslist that can bypass the broker situation but I'm not sure if this recommended or not. 
3. Anyone that has spent any time in the south knows that it's a pretty car-centric culture. Can't really get anywhere without one as public transit is usually pretty limited. My wife and I both have cars and have debated whether we'll need both of them. I know parking can not only be pretty limited in Boston but also incredibly expensive. Any thoughts on ditching one of or both of the vehicles? I do have family within driving distance of Boston so I think having at least one would be nice. 
4. If there is any other advice or general things to keep in mind about living in Boston I would love to hear it. We've visited the city several times in the past and we absolutely love it, but visiting the city and actually living there are two different stories. Having lived the past few years in Memphis I am very much looking forward to a change of scenery, but I know it will be pretty different culture wise. 

Thanks!",1

"I recently booked a flight to Miami in and out of Boston. I am from maine and when I booked my trip maine was considered a low risk state but since then, they have removed maine as a low risk state. I am only traveling to Boston to catch a flight out and back. Do I have to follow the travel form or am I exempt by the “transitory travel” meaning I’m just passing through the state, not actually staying there?

"Hi Guys,

I've just got an offer for an attorney position fresh out of law school at Trip Advisor in Needham. I'm nervous about moving from Brooklyn to the Boston area and was wondering if anyone can ease my fears.

Googling around, Needham itself is pretty expensive, and I have loans to pay back. Are the any neighborhoods around that's not too expensive and good for young people? Safe for women being alone?

Second, I'm a student of history and sports and I've read and heard a lot of bad things racially about the city. I'm black and I'm afraid of going there and sticking out. 

Please help me feel better, it would be dumb to turn down this opportunity in this economy.",1

"The area I usually park at is taken by Netflix for some production for 24 hours during 12/1. So I was looking at other streets to park at in my neighborhood (Boston Chinatown). So street cleaning is supposed to end 11/30 I think for daytime cleaning but the street I’m prospecting has a sign that says 2am-7am daily (Boston website has 12:01-7am daily). The city of Boston website states: “If you don’t see any months on a posted street sweeping sign, parking restrictions are in place year-round.” But the sign on the street doesn’t have any months, so safe to assume it’s year round nighttime street cleaning for these streets?

Any help is appreciated to clarify as I am quite puzzled.

I’ve never really noticed it until we would travel and then people would stop my mother and father who are tbh obnoxious and loud to ask them. When I met my now husband’s family from western mass they were constantly asking me to “keep talking” and say all sorts of things. I know when I get excited I do almost hear my own accent I guess. The weirdest was when I posted a video that went “viral” of my family and 9/10 of the thousands of comments would mention “Boston” “Pahk yah cah kid” it was so stupid.

"Hi all! I used to have a backyard where I composted in a spinning bin. I'm moving to a condo in Brighton that has an enclosed yard that only the condo residents can use that is now mostly used for the residents to walk their dogs. I hate to leave my compost bin behind and I understand that 99.99% there's some kind of condo rule for this spinning bin to not be taken to that 'park'. However, I saw a few condo residents using Compost Boston and other compost pickup services so there are some like minded folks in the building... I'm thinking maybe it's one of those things where it's worth trying to put that bin in that 'park' and see what happens? Or is this a big no no because I'll be told to remove the bin immediately and since it's huge I won't know what to do? I haven't moved there yet. Thank you in advance!",1

The door is part of the property and not the unit that we are renting, since it leads to the patio and has stairwell access to the unit above us and to the basement. We emailed the landlord letting them know what happened and they said that we should look at paying for repairs ourselves or via renters insurance. 

The lease states that any 'nuance' that results in damage to the leased premises will have to be covered by the lessee. 

Two questions here: since the door in question isn't directly a part of the unit we are renting, is it considered a part of the leased premises?
Secondly, would renter's insurance cover such a thing? To my knowledge, renter's insurance would cover the property that is owned by us within the unit and any immediate damage to the unit.",1

"Hello r/boston, my girlfriend, our two cats and I just recently moved here from Georgia. We wanted to move somewhere more connected that actually has 4 seasons. As an EE grad. I wanted to go somewhere with a tech scene and since she wants to do illustration I think there's art stuff here for her too. Regardless of the reasons, we've moved here and want to be able to actually go into and experience living here. 

I know there are plenty of posts here already to help people with finding a place to live and I've read the ones on the sidebar as well as others that I searched for. The problem is just that there's just so much to know. There are so many small areas and towns and I'm honestly feeling overwhelmed trying to figure out a good area to stay, it feels like I'm overlooking so much and won't even realize it for a while. That mixed with the pressure of paying for a hotel, dwindling funds and working full time is why I'm making my own post for advice. We're hoping to figure this out sooner rather than later and I'm hoping you guys can serve as a sanity check for our plan or suggest a better one. 

We want to be close enough to go into the city and actually experience living here but at the same time our jobs are in burlington. I have a car but once we get an apartment we were gonna find new (hopefully better) jobs closer to where we end up staying. My girlfriend is adamant about avoiding shared spaces because of the cats as well as because of previous bad experiences she's had. 

Together, with our $13/hour jobs we think we can afford about $1500/mo for rent. We were thinking of a 1br. apartment. A second bedroom would always be nice for the cats stuff or for if I could convince any of our good friends to move up and live with us to split rent, but I realize that isn't really going to be possible so were really just looking at 1 room. Her mom and my dad are both willing to cosign and we have good credit so I think we can get past the whole 3x-5x rent requirements a lot of places have. 

So considering all of that, we were looking at medford. I think it has good T access and is closer to everything while still not being too far from our current place of work. I think it'll give us a good place to find new jobs and still be centrally located. Although, like I mentioned, I'm sure there's plenty of stuff I'm missing out on here that we'll learn eventually. 

So I've got three questions. 
* Does our plan sound very feasible? 
* Do you all know any apartments for rent? 
* Do you guys have better suggestions?",1
"No body in the Bible celebrated a day called thanksgiving. People do not even know who God is. They are more interested in eating a turkey. People are really praying to the Devil. If your prayers were so right then why can't the people of this world pray to God and stop the virus?

The people know that their prayers are not heard. So praying over a dead bird is not going to help get your prayer answered. Being for real and sincere would help you.

How  can the turkeys all be white? The Devil is behind this whole thing that he set up about travelling long distances to sit down and eat a turkey which is white. The Devil manipulated the growing of turkeys to make them white. A white turkey could  not live in the wild. It would be shot on sight. When Jesus made the animals he made them so they would have a covering that would protect them. Like the deer who blend in. The birds blend in with the environment.

But the Devil had set it up to be a  white bird. It's a sign of a lie. This whole thing revolves around a dead bird on a platter and the Devil says ""Do it"" and they do it. They are showing they are obedient to the Devil's words. So you can see that the whole country is obedient to what the Devil wants. Yet they will not obey God's Word - they won't even study God's Word. They rather believe the lies that the phony ministers teach which is not according to the Word of God.",1

"I'm strongly considering just paying the tax penalty for not having insurance in 2021, I'm just finding it harder and harder to justify these prices. For the record [here is a comparison](https://i.imgur.com/iolNIop.png) between my current 2020 plan (left) and the corresponding 2021 plan. The premium remains mostly unchanged at $375, deductible is about the same, but the copays are pretty much all doubling or more?

So basically they want $4500 upfront, then they won't help at all with the first $3600. And even after I've paid $8100 they STILL expect me to pay $100+ to see a doctor, $1k to get an MRI, $1750 to go to the ER? wtf is the premium and the deductible for then?

And this is among the cheapest plans available. The only cheaper one listed only lets you go to their specific doctor basically, which won't work for me. And then if you want one of the ""better"" plans without the high deductible, the premiums are $8k+ anyway, so it's no different than just getting the cheap one and paying the deductible up front.

So what are the rest of you guys doing? Is this a normal amount to be paying? The max penalty for not having coverage is $1200 I think, so even if I pay that, it still leaves me with an extra $5900 to pay for any doctor visit out of pocket no?",1

Has covid loosened the restrictions on this? Or does Boston really just not care.

"It's time to bring back hazard pay for our local front line retail and grocery workers. With the holiday shopping season upon us and the increased shopper traffic with it, the risk and danger that they are exposed to has never been greater. COVID numbers are as bad as they've ever been, and our fellow Bostonians are putting themselves in danger to simply make a living.

 If you can, please reach out to your local retail stores to at least vouch for the people that make the holidays possible. Maybe with enough pressure from us, the customers, we can help bring some compensation to these front line workers for the danger they face so that the rest of us can enjoy the holidays.

When you submit the claim to your insurance, they see Carewell is in network and pay them the negotiated price. Carewell is then supposed to refund you. HOWEVER you cannot speak to anyone at Carewell and, if you leave a message, they don’t call you back. And this is only if you bother to follow up.

In my circumstance, Carewell now has both my payment AND the payment from insurance.

Does anybody here know ASL? The interpreter was (seemingly) cracking some jokes early on in the video.

**Charlie's Monologue**

- We are announcing a new public awareness campaign
- Massachusetts continues to be a national leader in access to COVID testing
- Thanksgiving represents a big potential risk for the spread of COVID-19, just as it was in Canada back in October.
    - Celebrate only with your household
    - If you do anything more than that (not recommended), keep it as short as possible and wear masks the whole time.
    - The state limit on indoor gatherings is 10 people.
    - College students need to receive a test before they leave campus. This is not just a Massachusetts rule.
    - Don't share food or drink, and open windows to allow for ventilation
    - Older people and those with pre-existing conditions are most affected by COVID.
    - If you plan to spend time with these people, take the proper precautions.
    - Do everything you can to keep things small..
    - Larger gatherings are simply not worth the risk.
    - mass.gov/thanksgiving2020 has more information
- The biggest single driver of spread these days in Massachusetts is household spread.
    - [I can't speak to the specifics of how the virus is spread in Massachusetts, but [that statement is not supported by evidence nation-wide](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/health/coronavirus-holiday-gatherings.html).]
- Many people who catch COVID will not have symptoms, or will have relatively light symptoms. So just because you don't feel sick doesn't mean you definitively don't have COVID.
- We are setting up at least one field hospital to support a surge of new COVID patients.
- There is hope on the horizon for vaccines, but right now COVID is a huge risk.
- We are launching a public awareness campaign called #getbackmass
    - ""It's a reminder that we must continue to fight so we can get back to the things we love to do.""
    - The campaign includes billboards, and TV and digital ads that will run through February.
    - We've been using a variety of channels to inform individuals throughout Massachusetts of our COVID policies, including the #maskupma campaign this past summer.
    - This campaign makes it clear that we'll be able to get back to the things we want to do if we (1) wear facemasks, (2) socially distance, and (3) get tested.

**Secretary Sudders's monologue**

- For the new campaign, we surveyed 1,000 people about their COVID-related behavior and how they reacted to specific motivators and messages
    - Based on the research, we classified people as ""COVID-cautious people"" (52%) or ""life-is-normal people"" (48%).
    - The most receptive messages were ones that indicated concern for the health/safety of loved ones, including above the health/safety of the people surveyed themselves.
- We are extending the Abbot BinaxNow testing program from K-12 to including long-term care facilities
    - They will be used to test people entering the facility who aren't part of the population or regular staff
    - You will not be allowed to enter the facility if you test positive
    - These tests should not be used for large-scale testing of all residents.
- Long term care facilities will now be doing weekly testing of all staff (up from every other week).
    - Additionally, facilities should test all residents and staff if there is a positive case reported from the facility.
    - The state continues to support surveillance testing costs for these facilities
- We announced $650K of grants for 20 faith and community organizations to reduce spread and increase awareness of COVID in communities of color in the hardest-hit towns.
- The COVID dashboard report that would normally be published this Thursday will instead be published on Friday.

**Questions for Charlie**

Reporter: According to the TSA, the volume of travelers in airports across the US is about 40% of what it was last year at this time. How frustrating is it to you that not everybody is listening to this message, even with a ""shiny new campaign""?

Charlie: The fact that travel data is down shows that our message has resonated with many people. We hope that even people who do travel are still following some of our guidance on mask wearing, social distancing, etc. 

R: What is Thanksgiving going to look like at the Baker household?

C: Our immediate family will be attending. I'll try to visit my dad at some point.

R: What is the plan in two weeks, assuming that a lot of people are traveling for Thanksgiving?

C: We obviously can't predict exactly what's going to happen in two weeks. We'll continue to look at the data. Over the weekend, we saw a dip in the number of people who are hospitalized with COVID, which is unusual for a weekend.

R: Do you have plans to open up new testing sites, given the long lines reported?

C: We have 250 testing sites in MA, not just the stop the spread sites. If you have insurance, you can get tested (for the most part) with no cost to you at all. We're gonna do what we can to expand our testing infrastructure, but we're not sure yet if the current surge in testing is related to people wanting to be tested before traveling for Thanksgiving. We're not gonna know that until we have a few days worth of data.

R: Are the protocols safe enough for people to take advantage of good Friday [I think he meant black Friday]?

C: Retailers in MA are looking forward to that, since they've had such a difficult period during the pandemic. If you're going to shop online, you can do so with local retailers. There are very few retailers—including local retailers—who don't sell online. If you are going to shop in person, make sure you follow the protocols set by the store. I would urge people to buy from Massachusetts-based companies if you're shopping online.

R: If the number of people taking tests continue to go up after Thanksgiving is over, is there a plan to increase lab capacity?

C: We anticipate that there will be additional capacity that will come online in mid-December.

R: If that doesn't solve a potential testing shortage, would there be a plan to ration tests like what was done in the spring?

C: Our goal is to have enough testing capacity to serve the people that are out there. There are billions of dollars in appropriated, but un-allocated, federal funds. This is a great example of why the current stalemate in Washington is such a problem. Just because its a lame-duck session doesn't mean people aren't still dealing with real-world problems.

R: You took part in a conference call with President-elect Biden last week. How are you feeling about an incoming administration? Are you encouraged that things will get better by January 20?

C: Kamala Harris was on that call too. I don't think we should be waiting until January 2020. There are a number of things that Washington needs to do before then, such as extending unemployment benefits. This would be a perfect time for congress to at least extend the agreements they already agreed on. I don't see why we would need to wait until January 20 for that to happen.

Additionally, vaccine distribution plans should definitely not wait until January 20. We already have a team in place in continual conversation with the feds. There needs to be a final review of the clinical trials, the addition of trials done by other companies, etc. Biden's transition team needs to be in contact and working with the white house task force that's been working on this for the last 10 months. The inability of these people at the federal level to get past the election will have seriously negative consequences for the people of this country.

R: Do you think Trump cares?

C: The president and his team needs to focus on what's directly in front of everybody in this country, which is COVID. Their second priority should be making sure that the transition goes as smooth as possible.

R: The forecast is calling for rain on Thursday for Thanksgiving, which might move people indoors. What enforcement would you like to see if people violate the indoor gathering limits?

C: We spend a lot of time talking to local governments about enforcement. Most of them are doing an ""appropriate"" form of enforcement, which entails telling people who are in big groups to simply go home, rather than fining people. But each community needs to handle it in a way that makes the most sense for them.

R: We are still hearing about people who are unemployed, whose benefits are still being held up. Should the state be assigning more people to this issue, and potentially update the numbers? [I didn't quite hear this question]

C: If someone is having an issue accessing the unemployment insurance system, they should reach out directly to the governor's office, and we'll follow up. Last week, there were 31,000 unemployment claims filed in MA, only 1,000 of which passed screening. There is an enormous problem with spammers trying to commit unemployment insurance fraud. This makes it very difficult to establish an accurate count. 

Additionally, there are many federal regulations that require unemployment insurance offices to make sure that they aren't paying money to people who don't exist or who aren't actually unemployed. This creates a ""time link"" for people who are actually entitled for unemployment benefits, where it can take some time to verify that they are legitimate.

R: Could you elaborate on the grant program?

Sudders: When the department of public health does large determination-of-need (DON) projects, we get new money specifically for community benefit programs, which is where this money is coming from. We tried to give this money to organizations with deep roots in their communities, that could reach people that aren't necessarily trusting of the government.

R: Can you give examples of how this money will be spent?

Sudders: We intentionally tried to not be too prescriptive with this money. We trust them to communicate to their communities awareness of COVID and how to protect themselves.

R: What does the vaccine rollout plan look like?

C: We currently process and distribute millions of vaccines per year. There is an existing infrastructure. With this vaccine, we need to ensure that the vaccine companies (1) ensure that they fully finish their clinical trials, (2) develop manufacturing protocols, and (3) begin manufacturing and distribution, with the idea that high-risk people will receive the vaccine first. We have a task force set up that communicates directly with the feds about what we need to do to follow through and deliver on the above points.

I don't want to put out hard numbers at this point because there are still a lot of unknowns, but we hope to begin vaccine distribution in early 2021 and ramp up for the first 5-6 months of 2021.

R: [Didn't quite hear this question, but it was related to vaccine distribution strategy.]

C: The big discussion is to focus distribution on healthcare workers, older individuals, and people with preexisting conditions, but that hasn't been fully decided yet.

R: Are you afraid that the pandemic is going to get worse before it gets better?

C: We pay the most attention to hospital capacity, which is currently at about 67% generally, and 48% in ICUs. In the spring, we missed a lot of cases because of test scarcity. There have been studies that we only found about 1 in 15 or 20 cases then. Now, its estimated that we find about 1 in 4 cases.

R: [Didn't hear, but I think he was asking about if the state was planning on changing the price it assigns to carbon emissions for setting climate policy.]

C: The transportation and climate initiative (TCI) was based on a set of assumptions about volume and congestion. Its possible that we'll be back to where we were at some point down the road. But at this point in time, we should re-examine the assumptions about what the impact would be of carbon reduction based on how transportation has changed in general. That's an important element for us and for the other states that are part of this initiative. We'll make a decision at the end of the year.

R: Cambridge is considering ending indoor dining. Thoughts?

C: Our policy has been to establish a statewide framework. We don't want towns to be more permissive than what our framework. However, we support towns' abilities to be more strict than what our guidelines allow for, if they feel it is necessary. However, (at this time) the statewide data does not imply a need to end indoor dining.",1

My family has chosen to stay apart for the holidays, but I'd really like to feel somewhat festive and eat delicious desserts. If anyone has a lead on poppy seed roll within a 2 hour drive (yeah I like it that much), that would be greatly appreciated.

If you weren’t aware, Salem State raised fees already this year. They are being funded the usual amount. No other public higher education institution in Massachusetts has turned to furloughs.

"The trains are different now, the tracks remain the same. 

The red line still goes from Alewife to Braintree, cutting the city in two. Red, empty veins, pumping only air. The blue line still courses to the airport, the occasional suitcase catching on a jagged chair leg. One fast pull and it’s free once more, quick. Efficient. Harsh. There’s no time now for mistakes. The green line still rumbles between empty college campuses, pausing for the occasional student to pass. Mask up, head down low. Trains pass by. No one enters.

The trains are empty now. 

Those who do enter the trains, do so with hurried purpose. They enter stiffly and quickly, choosing seats far from everyone else. A jammed workday commute is now only punctured by the occasional office worker with worried eyes. No one gripe the handrails. No one says a word. There’s no time to talk about the weather now, no time at all. 

One rider grips his Boston Globe tightly. He wants people to see he is reading it. But no one looks, no one cares enough to look. Not with everything else going on. He folds his paper. It falls discarded to the floor. 

The trains sound different now. The gentle rumble is now a roar, overwhelming even the most seasoned rider. “Pay attention to me,” the trains yell. “Don’t forget me.” 

“I’m so, so tired.” 

No one hears. No one can. 

The trains look different now. Cold, bright. Surgical. CDC advertisements plaster the walls. “You shouldn’t be here,” they caution. The trains disagree. “Come back,” they plead. 

And yet they hurry on, barreling through dark tunnels, under quiet city streets. 

The trains are different now: their destination, the same.",1

"Hi all! So basically I'm looking to move into Boston by 12/1/2020. I've gotten in touch with realtors (one from Gateway Real Estate Group, one from East Coast Realty), and there are two apartments that I like. 

The only issue is that it appears that both realtors want me to put down first month's rent before application approval and before signing a lease. This is so that I can ""hold down my spot"" apparently, which makes sense. From my digging online, it seems that this sometimes happens in Boston... but I'm just a little bit sketched out because I don't want to put down any money before any papers are signed. What's to stop them from taking the money and running? To make situations worse, one realtor is asking for payment via Venmo rather than credit/check, because my move-in date is apparently too soon to do credit/check. Paying via Venmo before a signed lease sounds like a trap to me.

So my questions is, is there any way for me to secure my first month's rent, even if they insist that I can't get a signed lease until I put money down? I'm asking them for a written contract stating that my deposit will be fully refunded in the event that my application isn't approved, but it looks like I'm getting a little pushback on that...

Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks so much. I just don't wanna get scammed!",1

"Last time I was surprised how many vendors were being almost safe - everyone had a mask somewhere, about 60% had it on their face. Yay.

Yesterday I start walking among the tents and my heart sinks as probably 30% of the vendors was wearing a mask, most of the ones without a mask did not carry a mask at all. And the folks that yell ""onedollaronedollaronedollar"" either did not have a mask on or took it down to perform their kulning.

Determined to get something out of this I keep wandering around the market while keeping a distance.

At my last purchase I'm relieved this vendor is at least wearing a mask - that he lowered to tell me the total of my purchase.

I thought the guy was going to pull over since the damage was significant and even the air bags were deployed, but instead he took off and almost hit more cars in the process of doing so. Luckily the driver of the Jeep was shaken but overall unharmed. The police came and took our statements as there were many witnesses. I believe that they are still looking for the mini van.

 Nobody in the Bible celebrated a day called Thanksgiving. People do not even know who God is. They are more interested in eating a turkey. People are really praying to the devil. If your prayers were so right then why can't the people of this world pray to God and stop the virus? **The people know that their prayers are not heard so praying over a dead bird is not going to help** get your prayers answered.

"For context: I'm fairly young and just started a new job, I work in the I.T industry and am hoping to move out of a crappy project development. 
Currently I am only a contract worker with no benefits but I just recently received good news from my manager (Who I have a great relationship with) that it's looking like I'll be getting a permeant position at the institute. This is huge for me considering one of the main reasons I haven't moved out of my mother's apartment is bc I haven't had a permeant job (Steady source of income) and have had fears of not being able to return once I jump ship. 

I was planning on saving $10,000 to move out and pay for first last and security and any additional expenses like pots &amp; pans would come out from that fund. (Ideally I'd make big purchases like couch's TVs and the such further down the line)

I don't really come from much and don't have a great grasp on financial spendings and am worried that that starting amount wouldn't be enough to stand on my own two feet and not be forced to move back in with family. 

Ideally I would be living alone close to the MBTA to get to work, I can figure out the shopping stuff as I go seeing as how I mostly shop online as it is.

Unfortunately, my permit is not recognized in Massachusetts, so I can't carry concealed in MA. Wish I could. On the other hand, since our two states don't have reciprocity, those of you who have a concealed carry license will find it's not good in Maine either. Too bad for both of us.",1

"Hello Bostonians, 

Will be flying into Boston on Thursday morning (November 19th) and looking for any and all recommendations. Will only be able to spend the morning and early afternoon before driving to my final destination in New Hampshire. Also will be flying back out of Boston on Tuesday night (November 24th) so will likely have a few more hours to spend in the city as well.

Ideally looking for a breakfast/brunch spot on Thursday, as of right now Lincoln Tavern is calling my name, but open to other suggestions. 

After eating would like to explore the city for a few hours, the recommendations I have received so far are mostly other food/drink related so looking for some diversity. Cheers (kinda touristy I know), Drink, Neptune, Tiger Mama and Harpoon Brewery. Some other locations that have caught my eye are Concepts, Fenway Park, Harvard Campus and The Boston Tea Party Museum.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the last minute request, procrastination is my specialty. I know this is far too short to see all of Boston, but would like to at least make the most of the time I do have in the city.

Also for those wondering, I have already taken all necessary trips to travel (negative COVID test and Massachusetts travel form) and will be following protocol wherever I do go.",1

"I'm a high schooler in Portland OR, applying to Northeastern, and I'm interested in trying to earn money on the side. Here, I've done yardwork services during the summer,  but we have pretty mild winters so there's never been much demand for shoveling. I understand Boston's situation is pretty different, and was thinking offering snow-shoveling services could be a good way to earn money during the winter. 

However, I don't really know how great the demand would be, or how people in Boston deal with the snow. Do most people in the metro area just shovel their own walks? Do you think many potential customers exist for this kind of service?  And aside from a shovel and some winter gear, what would be other good supplies?

Thanks in advance. I hope the flair fits",1
"Hey guys, so both parents are from the northeast and I’ve lived most of my life in Colorado and a California. A lot of kids I knew from college were from Boston area and I always got along with them. recently re located from San Diego to north of Atlanta and lemme tell you, I hate it. No public transportation, it’s wildly conservative, not much of a winter, the food sucks unless you like a heart attack after every meal, the city is too spread out, I could go on forever. Been all over the northeast, extensively to philly and New Jersey/New York and always loved it. I’m a huge foodie and love living in an urban environment. I’ve been successfully managing restaurants for around 3 years after working in sales after college. So I guess I’m asking, as someone who NEEDS to get out of the south what are some things I should consider about Boston? How’s the food scene? The social life? (Im 28) are there areas I should definitely avoid when looking to rent? Is it a good city to relocate too at my age? Is it pretty tattoo friendly? (Have a Japanese style sleeve) I know that might sound dumb in today’s age but I do live in 1966 down here below the mason dixon. Also if you have any questions for me to adequately answer my questions feel free to ask I’ll respond. Really appreciate it guys, thank you.",1

"Hey everyone- taking my group or young adult students into Boston on Wednesday. Want to keep them contained to Faneuil Hall so they can do some shopping, but in a specified area. The staff - 3 of us- need a central location to stay in order for students to meet up with us and to have a “home base” so to speak. I know the Starbucks there doesn’t have seating. Anyone know of a place in Faneuil Hall that DOES have seating? Thanks so much.

Update: thanks for realistic comments, if you made one. For anyone telling me how bad this idea is, or passively aggressively trying to put the virus on this one decision, let me be clear about something. This is not a “field trip” to have fun. This is a learning experience of the area because of the upcoming necessary events that this group has in Boston soon. We’re going to make the most of it since we’ll be there for about 2.5 hours, but there is a lot more behind this. This is only part 1 of what will need to be taught so this group can navigate to Faneuil Hall and Gov. Center for jobs, state trainings, and/or other state agency work. But again, thanks to others for actual helpful ideas.

"EDIT: Cat was removed from the tree around 4:45pm today, thanks to James who climbed the tree and got him down. Cat ran off after it was brought down, so he's still out and about, but hopefully he learned his lesson and stays away from trees!

\-----------

Hi all - I'm in Quincy and my friend who lives down the street has a cat that's been stuck in a tree for over two days. She first saw it on Saturday, but it then climbed higher into the tree and is too high/afraid to come down. From the looks of it, it doesn't look like a stray.

Here's a potato-quality photo: [https://imgur.com/a/qoa9Zau](https://imgur.com/a/qoa9Zau) (probably about 10-15ft of tree below the bottom photo edge)

Quincy Animal Control has not been helpful at all - they don't even answer their phone. Quincy FD came with a truck yesterday, but my friend's townhouse is part of a long row of buildings and the truck couldn't get close to the tree to use the ladder. And the tree is too unstable for the FD to climb or use a smaller ladder on. The tree is also located on the edge of the hill behind her complex and below the small hill are other houses, with no truck access.

The FD put a little bowl of food as far up as they could go (about 1/3 of the tree to the cat's position) but it certainly blew away last night.

We're not sure what to do, and the poor thing has withstood the torrential rain from last night and the wind/cold up that high. We're looking for any advice or suggestions on how to get it down.",1

"I recently moved into an apartment with old fashioned steam radiators. Of course, my skin is already starting to break, so I was looking into getting a humidifier, but of course those can be very fussy to deal with. I found out, though, about radiator humidifiers, [as shown here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M22WMS4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which can be hooked to the radiator and basically steam the room. While probably not as good as a mechanical humidifier, it seems like they require a lot less fuss so I'd like to try them.

However, I'm having a hard time to find them (evidently they're more popular in Europe than here). Most of the online options are plastic rather than ceramic, and they don't have great reviews. I haven't found a store that sells them either. I was wondering if anyone had purchased them before, and where they recommend buying them from.

I should mention that the radiators in my apartment are rounded on top, so unfortunately putting a cast iron steam on top won't work. I have put a pan of water below, but I know they should be in combination with other types of radiator humidifiers to work well.

Edit: I do want to mention I know about the Snow Joe ones, but that is plastic. I've heard ceramics work a lot better, so I was wondering if anyone know of a place that sold them.",1

"Tried to get a Covid19 test at (3) different Drive-Through test sites today and were turned away between 5-6pm. There is absolutely ZERO information on the websites/online as to whether the test sites were at capacity.

Saugus was open 2-7pm - capacity reached and was closed at 4pm

Revere was open 4-8pm - capacity reached and was closed at 5pm 

Winthrop was open 2-7pm - capacity reached and was closed by the time we got there at 6pm

There must be a better way of tracking whether these places are open/have reached capacity because we basically drove around for 2 hours trying to get a test. Is there a Twitter tracker or something?",1

"My Fiance and I are looking to move out of the city but having a tough time figuring out exactly where. We have been looking at a lot of different areas but our budget (~550K) seems to be very limiting. We like a town with some shops, parks, one thats safe and relatively low traffic. So far our short list is made up of the following: 
1. Hingham (too expensive, pipe dream)
2. Canton (will probably get a shit house for our budget)
3. Sharon ( high taxes, which lowers our price range)
4. Braintree (seems like it has some decent neighborhoods) 
5. Weymouth (most affordable but seems sketchy in some parts)

"Long story short I tested positive on Friday with very mild symptoms. My boss and a co-worker had a negative antigen test, but contact tracing said that since symptoms can show up 6 to 14 days after last known contact with a positive case, they have to quarantine for 14 days.  my boss however, stated that they will both be back in the office on Monday regardless. There are also people strutting around the office with no masks on despite management essentially pleading with everyone to be 100% compliant.

"Hello, 

I'm living in East Boston for 1 year. Due to irresponsible and disrespectful tenants, I will move out of my current apartment. I liked East Boston, groceries are close to my home, there are a lot of restaurants, waterfront parks, and so on. However, I found one room for rent in the North End and it made me think. It is 3 min away from Haymarket station and as I see from google maps area is crowded with restaurants and grocery shops. 

I did not do anything much in East Boston but I know the area well and I'm ok to live here, do you think moving to the North End will bring new experiences, and enjoyment to my life? 

If you choose north end over east Boston, what will be your reason?  

I think moving to a different part of the city will bring new connections to me. Do you agree with that?

"In my career field, it's pretty important to be able to speak another language. I sort of slacked in college while learning Arabic, but I also think it was way over my head. I want to take a chance and learn French to be able to advance my career, and also potentially go to grad school abroad. I took classes in high school but that was so long ago and I definitely didn't learn much in those classes. 

I know most classes will be online, but I'm okay with doing that for a couple months. I know how I learn, and definitely need an elementary class to get some basic footing before trying to learn by myself. Anyone have any suggestions?

"[Here is the update](https://www.mass.gov/governor-updates), in case anyone wants to watch it themselves. Secretary of Education James Peyser and Department of Education &amp; Secondary Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley are also present.

(Actual address begins at 7:00 with James F. O'Shea, Carlisle Superintendent giving opening remarks, thanks faculty, administration, superintendents, etc. for collaborating and working hard to make in-person learning possible. Thanks DESE and Baker for leadership and support. Jokes about additional funds after his speech.)

**Baker begins speaking at 9:40:** 

* appreciates the willingness of Carlisle staff to open their doors to Baker's administration so they can see what in-person learning looks like
* notes that while the state has created advisories, says that ""at the end of the day, it's up to places like this to fit the guidelines into how business gets done in this particular school and school district.""
* talks about furniture placement, distance in the cafeteria vs. classroom, and scheduling shifts for lunch- some kids eat in class, some in the cafeteria depending on how shifts work
* the classrooms themselves, ""it's obvious you're using every square inch of space that's available in those classrooms""
* ""every kid, every child we saw was wearing a mask and didn't seem all that stressed about it, which makes them a lot more mature than many of the adults I know.""
* reminisces about... algebra in 8th grade, ended his tangent by saying how this reminds him of how important it is to get kids back in the classroom together 
* ""we've tried very hard as a state to provide people with guidances and resources, but we recognize that the 'how' is ultimately going to get made at the local level where they know their districts best.""
* ""to make change, you need people who are willing to try.""

**Commissioner Riley begins speaking at 15:01**:

* this visit reminds him of how important it is to see kids in school, congratulates the faculty and town for making this happen in Carlisle

**Baker resumes at 15:26, opens up to questions:**

* *Question 1- interrupts journalist to ask for an ""on-topic question first""*
* *Question 2- How can we make decisions like this work in other areas? \*inaudible\** 
   * Superintendent round-tables are part of the answer- having schools that are doing this and getting it done creates a template and a set of thoughts and ideas that makes it possible for other people to learn from it.
* *Question 3- \*inaudible question, something about parties, Wellesley, and Marlborough\**
   * The data is pretty clear that kids and schools are not where the vast majority of community transmission takes place, the best example of this is with parochial schools - almost 30,000 kids and 4,000 staff in person since August with less than 40 cases, and none of those cases originated inside the school. With almost half a million kids, staff, and faculty in some form of hybrid or in-learning, very small numbers with regard to infection and none of which originated in schools. Baker thinks the big message is that the public health and pediatric community have made very clear that if you follow the guidance, your opportunity to do the right thing on behalf of kids is to get them back in the classroom.
* *Question 4- We're closing in on \*inaudible\* numbers- yesterday we saw almost 2500 cases, it seems that we're reaching uncharted territory?*
   * We're nowhere near the uncharted territory we were in in the spring. Nowhere near it. Nowhere. Definitely dealing with a surge we talked about in the summer/fall, currently the largest per capita tester in the state. 80k-100k tests per day, ability to identify cases dramatically better than in the spring. Healthcare system better equipped to handle this than we were in the spring. Talking to them almost daily, and we'll have more to say about this tomorrow when we talk about the field hospitals we're planning on reopening. 
   * ""I think in many ways, this is not just an issue for MA but for the entire country.""
   * Quotes Washington Post article that the vast majority of spread is dinner parties, game nights, small informal casual gatherings with a bigger circle of friends than people were spending time with. That is in many respects what makes this so insidious. For us to win this fight, people have to recognize that spending time outside of their core circle, their core family circle, without wearing masks and distancing, your risk to contract and spread is so much higher.
* *Question 5- When people see that eye-popping number which they haven't seen since summer, what do you mean we're nowhere near that?*
   * We currently have 550 people in the hospital. We had close to 5,500 people in the hospital at the peak of this back in the spring. 10x as many people, it's many different. If you look at the DPH data book posted every day, the slope of the line was linear in the spring. I've talked about the fact it's moved since Labor Day, and that's why we changed some of the rules. The big message that is critical in all of this is familiar people being familiar in familiar settings is really, not just here, but all over the place, the major element driving the spread at this point. Mentions youth hockey, and the act of physically playing hockey - all of the socialization between kids and adults. 
* *Question 6- follow up question on hockey:*
   * Thinks all states in the Northeast agree it's the interstate games and what happens off the ice that drives transmission. Wants to set rules and guidelines to lower transmission. Admits he wants everyone playing across the region with the same, regularly enforced guides but it's going to take a few weeks to figure out how to do that.
* *Question 7- Carlisle is a smaller, more affluent community where people can afford buying more desks, etc. that's not possible in a  lot of districts, so what do you say to those schools?*
   * We recognize a significant investment needed to be made across the Commonwealth, so that's why $1 billion was invested in MA over the course of the summer specifically to pay for and reimburse schools. 
   * Many of the special needs programs, oftentimes more complicated to operate, have been in person and stayed in person through the summer and fall. That is close quarters, and there too there's been really ""modest spread"" and transmission.
   * The data is clear, the real issue is can people learn from those who have been successful and incorporate that into their own learning?
* *Question 8- socialization outside of school*
   * Superintendent takes over, notes that it's a challenge to monitor students outside of school. Administration works closely with the community, meeting 1x/week to coordinate in-school and community public health issues. Community-oriented approach to resolve conflicts.

"Posted this question in another subreddit, but went without answer, so kinda figured to post here:  


I  am seeing that currently road test in Massachusetts is being driven in  state vehicles (or the driving school vehicles). I am wondering if the  car you arrive in is still being looked at? What I mean is: prior to  corona the car you would arrive in would be the one you would take the  road test in. And that car needed to fulfill certain requirements  (central/accessible hand brake, etc). I am wondering currently when you  arrive to the test does your car have checks from instructor and then  you drive in state vehicle, or they dont look at the car and you just go  into the state vehicle?

The  reason why I ask is that my car doesnt have central hand brake and thus  would be unsuitable for the road test. So I would be failed pre-corona  if I came with it. But if they are not looking at the car, I can just  use it and not go arround asking people to lend me car (which during  corona is not looked upon kindly). I have a road test coming up in  Plymouth.  


TLDR; Does the car you come in get checked up as before corona, or are you just given state vehicle?",1

"Serious replies only - I need help figuring this out. I plan on getting a mini Goldendoodle next year in spring or summer. Today I asked the real estate agent that listed the property for rent from the landlord if I could get an animal because my lease mentions no pets are allowed unless landlord gives written consent for one. I enquired the real estate agent regarding the process and she flat out said that the landlord has no dog policy except for support dogs. 

I replied to her saying that that was a bummer but there was a dog in the building that didn't seem like a support dog (I got confused between support dog and service dog because service dogs tend to wear vests saying they are service dogs and this dog doesn't) and said that there was one in the building. The real estate agent got back to me saying not to get my hopes up and that the landlord is probably not going to allow a dog. And then I replied telling her that I looked up if depression and anxiety were listed as ""Disability"" under the American Disability act and I wasn't aware of this because I am not from this country. I asked her if there was a note I could get from my psychiatrist mentioning that I have depression and anxiety in order to be able to get an ESA. The real estate agent immediately got back to me saying that I couldn't just create or makeup conditions just to get an ESA. I ended up sending her screenshots of my depression, anxiety and insomnia medicines and she didn't reply to those. 

Now I can get a note from my psychiatrist for an ESA, but can my landlord still reject it? I initially **did not** state that this dog would be for emotional support but I had no idea you could even get one for emotional support and when I looked it up, it mentioned ESAs can be for people who suffer from depression, anxiety, etc. Is the landlord going to reject on the grounds that I switched from it being just a dog to an ESA once the agent mentioned only ESAs were allowed? Can I still sue the landlord if he denies me an ESA? 

I suffer from depression, anxiety, and grief from trauma and could use an ESA and had no idea you could get one for those until now. And I also mixed up service dogs and support dogs due to which I didn't mention the ESA initially either. Do I have any hopes of getting a dog?",1

I noticed some of them have a link to a separate visitors/tourism/etc subreddits. They then will delete any basic posts such as “what to do this weekend?” Or “me and my cat want to do the freedom trail, where should we eat after?” You get the point. Then the auto mod will direct them to post in the tourism subreddit.

Would something like this work for us? 

I know some folks here actually enjoy replying to those type of questions, I do occasionally, as long as they aren’t totally vague questions, or if they are somewhat unique or well-thought out. 

Not sure if it would work for us with the large amount of people that come here for work and school? Some questions are asked over and over, but I wouldn’t consider them tourist or visitor questions, just new to the city stuff.

If there was a separate sub for that kind of stuff, I feel like the people that ask questions would be less likely to get shitty snarky answers, because only the people that wanted to be helpful that are local would subscribe?

Would it clear out the commonly asked questions, and lack of looking at the sidebar by almost everyone that comes here, if those posts were just deleted?

**Charlie's monologue**

- Since labor day, cases have tripled, and hospitalizations have doubled
- The trends are going in the wrong direction, and [the trends] show no signs of changing.
- Creating enough space to treat COVID patients and other patients is the most important factor in planning for a surge.
- We hope to not need to use these resources, but preparing now will allow us to keep schools, the economy, and hospitals open.
- In the spring, we had no choice but to cancel or delay elective and routine medical procedures.
    - We hope to not have to repeat this.
- We are making 400 beds available by converting acute care beds to ICU beds
- We are setting up the field hospitals again, like what was done in April.
- Controlling this virus depends on the everyday actions of everybody.
    - We are seeing a spike in positive cases, mostly because people are letting their guard down.
    - Make sure to wear a mask, wash your hands, and socially distance
    - We introduced new gathering limits, and a 10 PM - 5 AM curfew to reduce the spread.
    - We don't want to go back to the restrictions from last spring, and we need everyone's help to make sure that it doesn't happen.
- Its encouraging to see the Biden white house plans to focus on COVID starting on day 1.
    - We hope that the federal action will be less politicized and more effective.
- We are encouraged by the new vaccine data from Pfizer
    - When the time comes, Massachusetts will be ready to distribute a vaccine.
    - Its important to remember that we will be living with the virus for at least the next few months
- I'm dismayed to hear the baseless claims about the electoral fraud from the president and other Republicans in Washington
    - Stalling the transition at this moment in the crisis is wildly irresponsible
    - [Charlie sounded pissed during this part of the monologue]

**Secretary Sudder's monologue**

- ICUs are currently at 50% occupancy
- Overall hospital occupancy has remained at 65-70% throughout October
- Hospitals are open and are continuing to serve all patients with medical needs
    - Statewide, hospitals are treating 7,000 patients
- We have conducted inspections of 8,700+ businesses to ensure COVID safety compliance since August 11.
    - 97% are in compliance with all rules and guidances
    - 2% were issued verbal warnings
    - 98 were charged with operating in violation of the executive orders

**CEO of Lowell General Hospital Jodie White's monologue**

- [Mr. White is also the chair of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital System Board of Trustees]
- We don't know precisely what the second wave of COVID will look like, but we are in a much better position to respond than we were in March and April.
- Our hospitals were never overwhelmed during the first COVID wave because we were able to prepare, and people socially distanced
- Get a flu shot to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system
- Do not delay care. We are well-equipped to meet your medical needs.

**CEO of Boston Medical Center Kate Walsh's monologue**

- We are confident that we will not see the numbers of the first surge
    - [[This isn't necessarily true. Already, US hospitalizations are at a record high.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/10/world/covid-19-coronavirus-live-updates?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#us-hospitalizations-reach-a-record-high-as-medical-facilities-are-under-strain)]
- We have a year's supply of PPE available.
- We are confident that we will be able to care for COVID patients and all other patients over the next few weeks.

**Questions for Charlie**

Reporter: Without a peaceful transfer of power, what does that mean for vaccine distribution?

Charlie: Vaccine distribution is a process that is already well underway. At this point in time, its important for individuals in key roles in the federal government to be working and talking to people on Biden's transition team. Its critical that there is a focus on COVID at the federal level as we enter the coming weeks and months. Currently there isn't guidance, or a persistent message coming from Washington on the virus.

R: What can you say about the distribution of the vaccine? Which groups will you prioritize to receive the vaccine?

Secretary Sudders: At this point, its our understanding from the federal government that the states will be  establishing what the priorities are for who receives the vaccines. We've advocated Washington that the allocation of the vaccine should be done on a state per-capita basis, but so far there has been no indication from the feds about what the next steps are. [We have the current plan posted right now](https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-interim-draft-plan/download), but it is a very general plan. 

Massachusetts distributes millions of vaccines each year, so we already have good infrastructure in place to allocate the COVID vaccine(s).

R: Would elder care facilities and hospitals be at the top of the list [for who would receive the vaccine first]?

Sudders: Healthcare providers and older individuals with compromised immune systems are at the top of the list, but it really depends on how many vaccine doses we get from the federal government.

Charlie: We're still waiting to see what the actual delivery mechanism of the vaccines will be. There's a number of ways to deliver a vaccine (such as going to the nearest CVS or Walgreens) that people in long-term care facilities would not be able to safely access.

R: Have you or anyone from the Massachusetts administration been in contact with the incoming Biden administration?

C: There are a bunch of ""Boston folks"" who are in his COVID advisory group, but our governor's office has not been in contact yet.

R: The Pfizer vaccine would have to be kept at -80 C [[the actual temperature is -70 C](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-as/how-pfizer-vaccine-could-be-cold-comfort-for-some-asian-nations-idUSKBN27Q1G1)]. Are there any concerns about how that would affect distribution?

Sudders: The vaccine will come from McKesson packed in dry ice which will keep it cold for 8-10 days, and many of our hospitals have cold storage that will allow us to store the vaccine for a longer period. There are also a number of days where it doesn't have to be in cold storage before being administered.

R: What's the PPE situation in long-term care right now? [We've had a report [from August] that said that supplies are relatively low](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/08/08/massachusetts-senior-care-association-chief-worries-about-testing-ppe-as-coronavirus-creeps-back/).

Sudders: That was a troubling report, because we've been closely monitoring PPE supplies in nursing homes. Nursing homes report directly to the federal government. Of the 36 nursing homes that reported PPE shortages, 27 belonged to one company. This company believed that it needed to make a statement that they have shortages with respect to the ""conventional"" [pre-pandemic] standards, but not with respect to the ""conservational"" standards. They felt the need to make this point to the federal government by claiming that they had a shortage. 

The department of public health reached out to all 36 nursing homes from the report, and they all attested that they had sufficient levels of PPE.

R: Would you say that we are in the midst of a second surge right now?

C: Yes. This was predicted by a number of epidemiologists, and it is occurring across nearly all western countries. The enhanced amount of testing we're doing gives us much better knowledge of the movement of the virus throughout the state.

In contrast to last spring, where the rate of hospitalization increase and the rate of case increase were about equal, the current rate of hospitalization increase is about half that of the rate of case increase. This allows us to create capacity to offset the increase.

R: Are you worried that the ongoing election is ""gumming up"" the federal COVID response?

C: At this point in time, its hard for states to know what the week-to-week game plan is going to be. The current administration needs to be bringing Biden's COVID task force up to speed so we don't miss a beat.

R: How do you feel about releasing inmates with COVID? [Congressman Pressley recently urged you to do so](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/11/10/ayanna-pressley-pandemic-prisoner-release-massachusetts).

C: Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've paroled hundreds, possibly thousands, of people who would be better served in the community due to COVID. Our prison system has done a great job of keeping inmates safe from COVID. When they had an outbreak at the Norfolk prison, they moved aggressively to test everyone in the facility.

R: Has there been any discussion about moving back a phase or two?

C: There have been a number of towns that are in stage 3, step 1. We have also made changes to specific activities or communities (such as ice hockey) that are showing more COVID risk.

R: [I didn't quite hear this question, but it was about some republicans attacking other republicans who recognized Biden as the election winner]

C: I've been a republican for 40 years, and I believe in many things that the republican party stands for. One thing I don't believe in is the idea that ""elections are only legit if you win"". [Charlie was visibly angry when answering this question.]

R: Does the republican party that you support still exist?

C: Yes

R: The Celtics announced that Tommy Heinsohn has passed away. Any thoughts?

C: I'm old enough to remember Tommy as a player. He would get 20 points a night, get 15-20 rebounds, and cover the best player on the opponent's team. As an announcer, he was so profoundly committed to rooting for the home team that you would think he was watching a completely different game. That guy was all heart.

R: The GOP party leadership has had very pro-Trump  messaging. Is it time for a change of message?

C: We spend a lot of time focused on republicans in the state legislature. For 2022, we will need to recruit some candidates and focus on the issues that people care about, which are usually different than national issues.

R: Will you be on the ballot in 2022?

C: That's a long time away.",1
"Link to the state's [weekly report](https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-covid-19-public-health-report-november-5-2020/download). I highly encourage you to read this report every week.

I was curious how the COVID numbers are breaking down, now that we're in an upswing.

By far, most clustered transmission are [via household](https://i.imgur.com/VzbgaFf.png), defined as a [shared residence](https://i.imgur.com/qdo4qrI.png)

Cases [per capita by town](https://i.imgur.com/yWlcOC2.png) vary greatly. Reading the per-town data, there's a pattern that the highest cases per capita are still in towns with the lowest per-capita income.

[By age group](https://i.imgur.com/LBuayoE.png), people in their 30s have the highest cases per capita.

We are still losing an average of about 20 lives in MA per day to this disease. Before COVID, on an average day in MA, there were 160 deaths per day.

Please continue to be mindful. I understand that many of us have to continue to work and put ourselves in risky situations. Many of are forced to live with many roommates or large families.

This whole thing sucks, but the more we pay attention to the data and risk factors, the better we'll be able to mitigate the damage.",1
"I love weed just as much an anyone else, but just wanted to give a PSA because this is the third time in the last year and a half that this has happened. I know no one expects this to happen when they toss their roaches, but it can and it does so just asking those looking to enjoy a nice joint out there to be mindful of how they dispose it. That is all",1
"The people who crowded into the street yesterday were irresponsible. Those who did it without masks and/or an effort to stay distanced were very irresponsible. Of those people, the ones who are also criticizing Trump rallies and otber poor pandemic behaviors are big hypocrites.

The gatherings should have received more criticism and condemnation from people like Walsh, Baker, and even Biden. This is important for credibility, consistency of message, AND public safety. The lack of stern criticism was irresponsible and probably partisan, to a degree.

**None of this is evidence that COVID is no big deal, and none of this suggests that we should open up other activities and events.** People being dumb hypicrites about a public health hazard doesn't somehow erase the public health hazard. Large outdoor gatherings are still somewhat risky. Sustained indoor gatherings of any size are still very risky. Gatherings without masks are still very risky.

On top of all that, pushing the limits on those risks for pure pleasure adds a whole.other level of shitty-ness to the behavior. Going out in the street with a mask to demand justice for police violence or some other problem is already a risk, but at least the motives are for some kind of ""righteous"" or well-intended cause. Going out in the street just to fuck off and party is indefensible in comparison.

The fact is, a **lot** of people were selfish and irresponsible yesterday, and we **should** feel right to criticize them for it. That doesn't change the situation moving forward. Don't use one mistake as a justification for repeating that mistake. Let's at least work together a tiny bit to not get completely fucked by this virus.",1

"Great Conversation and Food! $800/mth

I am looking for a female boarder-roommate for a furnished room in a two-bedroom, 600 sq ft apartment in south Waltham, near Moody St.. Earliest availability  December 1. I am a 59 year old female writer, good cook and morning person. Since it’s as easy to cook for two as for one, I’m offering to supply food as well as all utilities (heat, electricity, Internet.) There is laundry on the premises and a yard! No off-street parking, but it’s a quiet side street and it’s not usually hard to find parking. Very close to the riverwalk. I’m looking for someone one quiet and responsible, who is not here all the time. We can discuss Covid precautions in person/over the phone. Unfortunately, the apartment is not handicapped accessible; one full staircase. Small pets negotiable. There is no storage outside of the bedroom closet.

Food, etc.: I expect that I will be able to provide about 70% of your meals. You would be welcome to half of all the food in the house and expected to do your own dishes, and generally be neat and clean. Taking the trash out occasionally would be great as would be taking a turn cleaning the bathroom &amp; kitchen floor. This is an environmentally conscious household. I ask that you recycle and conserve energy. You’re welcome to take a ‘brown bag’ lunch to work/school. I cook almost everything from scratch, avoid foods with coloring or preservatives and use seasonal vegetables. My meals tend to be light on meat (all kinds as well as chicken and fish), dairy and grains and heavy on vegetables. I cook two or three main courses a week, and often something else, like yogurt (I make it myself) or a salad. I keep healthy snacks on hand, usually fresh/dried fruit and canned fish/cheese to eat with crackers. I don’t keep sweets on hand. If you want you’re welcome to occasionally cook for yourself, prepare yourself a snack and bring in whatever additional food you want.  I don’t serve meals at a particular time, rather you can take what you want from the fridge and heat it up yourself. We’ll probably occasionally sit down to a meal together but it’s not scheduled. Very light alcohol &amp; marijuana use ok. All of this is subject to minor adjustments. 

Here is a list of what I’ve cooked recently: chicken marbella, lentil burgers, curried squash soup with coconut milk, sauted broccoli rab, roasted root vegetables, beef stew, bean stew with yucca, chayote &amp; pork, buckwheat pancakes with molasses and sesame oil, orange juice cucumber oregano smoothie, white bean soup with kale and linguica, lentil stew with lamb bits, carrot ginger soup, stir fried rice &amp; vegetables. 

Please respond with a little bit about yourself and your plans for the future. All races &amp; ethnicities welcome, gay friendly. I’ll probably do a phone screen and may want to meet you more than once before making a decision. In addition to first month’s rent, I’ll need one month’s rent as security deposit/last month’s rent.",1

"Hey there, as the title is pretty self explanatory I don't have to give too much info here but will give my endgame goals:


- Free Broadcast Channels (Boston 4, 5, 7, 25, the more the merrier)
- 3 TVs (4th added sometime in the next year im sure)
- DVR service (not a requirement right away but if it's the easiest solution I'm open, would want at some point in future)

Our setup:
- Basement Tv in mancave, TV 1st floor living room, TV upstairs master bedroom
- Amazon Fire stick on 2, Nvidia Shield on 1
- Gigabit internet
- Streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, contemplating SlingTV

What we primarily watched before cutting the cord:
- Me: Pro sports (not much college), and streaming, etc (I personally can also use kodi for my needs)
- Wife: HGTV, Lifetime, E, Food Network, Programs on local Broadcast stations (ABC, NBC, FOX, etc)
- Son: he's only 2.5 yrs old. Disney+ works for him

We just cut the cord officially yesterday. We live in Weymouth, MA so the broadcast towers are in 3 or 4 main directions from our house. Unfortunately our house has no clear line of site outside as we have a farmers porch in the front and trees in the back.

I'm willing to attach an antenna to the roof if necessary (there's already a directv dish I'll reuse the spot and cabling)

I understand there are several options right now. I could get an airtv to connect the antenna to the airtv which them sends the signals to any tv that has a smart device (they all do), but if doing that I can just use locast.

Do any of you in this area use an indoor antenna and have good results on the south shore? Is an outdoor roof antenna overkill for my location?

I don't want to go overkill if I don't have to with a roof antenna, but if it's easy enough to do so with the dish being on the roof, I don't mind spending $150 for an amplified antenna and a splitter.

For DVR, is the recast or AirTV any good or do you recommend something else?

"Voters across Massachusetts went out to the polls in droves on Election Day, although turnout in Boston appeared Wednesday to not have eclipsed that of the two previous presidential elections as some speculated it could, city officials said.

Approximately 63.5 percent of registered city voters cast a ballot — slightly less than the 66.75 percent of voters who did so four years ago, and the 65.87 percent recorded in 2012, according to Mayor Marty Walsh.

“Boston yesterday beat the 2008 turnout,” Walsh told reporters. “So it wasn’t one of the highest. I guess if you average the last four presidential elections, we’re right in the average place.”

As a whole, Bay State voters surpassed the 3.3 million ballots cast in 2016, Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin said. He anticipated the final number to come in over 3.6 million as expected.

Walsh said city officials were still counting domestic mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday and will continue to do so through Friday. Overseas ballots can be counted through Nov. 13.

“These numbers that we have in Boston are not final,” Walsh said. “The work is still going on and every vote must be counted.”

Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden carried the vast majority of votes in Boston against Republican President Donald Trump, or about 82.5 percent to Trump’s 15.6 percent, unofficial results show. Democratic Senator Ed Markey saw a similar landslide with 82.7 percent of the city’s vote against Republican challenger Kevin O’Connor.

Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, of the 7th Congressional District, beat out Independent Roy Owens in Boston with just over 87 percent of the vote, while Congressman Stephen Lynch, of the 8th District, garnered 84.1 percent of ballots to be reelected over Jonathan Lott, of the Healthcare Environment Stability Party.

Boston voters also fell in line with the majority of voters across the state on Question 1 to approve expanding Massachusetts’ right-to-repair law. However, while most Bay State voters shot down the proposal for ranked choice voting in Question 2, voters in the Hub apparently wanted to see the effort carried out, with 61.7 percent casting their ballots in favor of the system. [Haney vs Gamboa Live StreamS-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haneyvsgamboaliveHD/)

Voters in the city also handedly backed two non-binding ballot questions.

Question 3 asked whether lawmakers should “vote in favor of legislation that would require Massachusetts to achieve 100 percent renewable energy use within the next two decades, starting immediately and making significant progress within the first five years while protecting impacted workers and business.” Question 4 asked whether representatives should vote to change state House of Representative rules to make all House legislative committee votes publicly available online.",1

"Hi everyone!

A couple months ago my girlfriend, her friend and I planned to drive from NY to Boston for a weekend (this upcoming weekend). Since last week, I have been monitoring the situation with COVID-19 as it has been steadily increasing in Boston, and now there are new stay-at-home orders that go in effect on Friday. This is on top of the election so stores/businesses/restaurants are boarding up heavily in case of protests/riots.

For those that live in Boston, specifically the downtown area or Back Bay, what is it like? Would there be anything to do, such as historic sites (some of which are closed temporarily from what I've researched), walk the parks, etc? With the election &amp; COVID, I can't think of things I would be doing in Boston that I couldn't just do here in NY.

Also, based on what I read on the NY gov site, it seems we would need to fill out the travel form before returning to NY and we would have to take a COVID test in Boston before returning. Then we would have to quarantine for 3 days and take another test in NY. Does anyone know if my understanding of this is correct?

*For travelers who were in another state for more than 24 hours:*

*- Travelers must obtain a test within three days of departure from that state.*  
*- The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.*  
*- On day 4 of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain another COVID test. If both tests comes back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.*

I am wishing we went a few weeks ago as it doesn't seem like the best idea to go now, but I would like advice from those who have done the trip/live in Boston, as it would be my first time there.

Thank you in advance!",1

It also asks for details of old title, which I dont have)

So, which form should I use?

Since RMV only accepts postal requests for these, I dont want those original docs from Toyota to be discarded if I fill in the wrong form or miss some document.",1

2. If the voting machines are down, request a paper ballot.
3. Think you made a mistake on your ballot? Ask officials for a new one.
4. Requested an absentee ballot, but didn’t use it? That’s fine, you can just vote in-person (except in Kentucky, but I doubt that will be a problem).
5. If the election official says you’re not on the roll of registered voters, don’t panic: ask for a provisional ballot. Your vote will be counted after Tuesday, when they confirm your registration status.
6. If your eligibility is challenged, ask to submit a sworn statement.

"On April 8th, 2020 I sent an EMAIL to TSI Membership Services (in charge of BSC's HR stuff) an email demanding a refund for a payment during the gym closures as well as a cancellation request. 

I have now, in November, been charged AGAIN by this club. 

I emailed the TSI Membership services and was redirected to a broken website via this email: 

&gt;***Please note the below is an automated response. This mailbox was set up as a temporary solution during mandated closures. With the reopening of our clubs, this mailbox is not being actively monitored. Any email sent to it will not receive a response.***


&gt;***We realize not all locations are open but we are working to reopen as many locations as possible based on local regulations. Members can call or visit any club for service needs. We also offer a Contact Us option on our website. Freeze or cancel requests can be processed at any open location in our network. Please consult our website for open clubs in your local market. (See websites by market below)***


&gt;We look forward to seeing you back in the clubs. Below are some of the safety protocols that have been put into action.

 
&gt; Operating hours will vary according to Gov’t regulations by State

&gt;Some cardio equipment will be removed and/or disabled to respect the 6’ Social Distancing rule

&gt;Personal Training is available at open locations. Please contact your local club regarding other services (Babysitting, Pool, etc.)

&gt; Restrooms will be open (if local mandate allows) and equipped with signage indicating 6’ distances 

&gt; Unless mandated otherwise, lockers will be designated 6’ apart for storing personal belongings

&gt; Members will be required to take their temperature prior to entering into the club and wear protective masks or face coverings during their entire workout experience

"My driver's license expired. Didn't even realize it until a couple months after the expiration date. I applied for a new one online, got confirmation the request was received and a notice of text to print out and carry with me while I drive to attest that my replacement driver's license is on its way. The RMV site still said a 7-10 day delivery period.

It's been 3 weeks. I still don't have it.

The RMV site says not to contact them unless it's been a full month since I expected to receive it. Seems strange.",1
"Hello, I'm currently losing my mind with the state's unemployment system (and I'm not even the one making the calls!)

My friend has been told that she owes $10k in overpayment, but is flabbergasted and confused why, all of a sudden, she has been told this after having reduced hours and receiving money through the UI system since May.

She filed an appeal, and through the USPS knows that the files were received two weeks ago, but she cannot for the life of her connect to a live UI person. The live hotline, which is supposed to connect to the UI customer service, literally hangs up the phone on you when it connects. She also has no way to track the status of this appeal through their online system. 

It's completely frustrating and she wants more information or piece of mind to know that this is being taken care of. Has anyone had any similar experience? Is her main route to just assume it's being processed and to hang tight until they contact her?

(being told you owe $10k obviously causes a lot of anxiety and shock, and it's now been 3+ weeks of hitting this road block with UI)",1
"Effective November 2nd, certain plates and/or registrations ordered through Registration Drop Off Centers will be centrally distributed and mailed from the new Lowell Fulfillment Center. 

Centrally distributed plates will now be sent from both Lowell and Quincy Headquarters. 

Plates/registrations will be mailed to owners if they have a Massachusetts state-assigned number (S/SA#). Customers who do not have a state-assigned number will still need to pick up their plates/registrations at the Registration Drop Off Center. 

This applies both to transactions dropped off by individual customers and by commercial customers (such as agents and runners).",1
"Since Baker allowed the eviction moratorium to expire on October 17th, we're expecting to see a massive rise in evictions starting this month. According to CityLife/ Vida Urbana's [August 2020 report](http://www.clvu.org/eviction_risk_august2020): 

&gt;One in three Massachusetts renter households are at risk of eviction according to the latest data from a U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse survey during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Black and Hispanic renters are at far greater risk of eviction than white renters both state-wide and in the Boston metro area, according to the data.""

" 

I  am located on the South Shore of MA (south of Boston) and wondered if  people had suggestions as to their favorite greenhouse or garden center?   I've got a place nearby that has good soil and mulch, but I am looking  for a place that has really good quality and variety of vegetable and  herb starts in the spring.  My local place has all the standard veg  starts, but I am looking for more variety and want to crowd source your  favorite places!  When living in greater Boston I used to go to  Allandale Farm in Brookline, which had an amazing selection and variety  of veg starts in the spring.  Sadly, that's just too far for me to drive  (and hauling two kids over there and the parking situation...) to get  my starts.

As  well, looking to find a nice greenhouse that I can go to in the winter  and be surrounded by beautiful plants, and probably end up buying a few  new houseplants.  Because we can always use a few more houseplants  right??  There's a few windows in my house that are definitely lacking a  plant in them.",1

I haven't heard anything at all about transmissions in gyms and the staff is very tight lipped when I've asked them.

"I'm worried about you, your friends, family, everyone in the germosphere.

I wonder if your mask falls down your face or slides below your nose when you talk because it doesn't fit correctly. Do you have a non-standard face/head size? Me too. That makes wearing a standard mask a bit tough.

Maybe you get grossed out by all the surgical masks in the street and gutters and are nearly sickened by the sight of a disposable mask. I understand they serve a purpose, but ew, me too. 

I would be willing to make you a cloth mask or two. Something that can stay on your face when you talk. Maybe something that even looks a little cool.  

This isn't the business I'm in or anything, more of a calling. Also, I'm not at all an expert seamstress, but I've been making my own masks since the start. 

Once again, I'm not selling these. I'm offering. I have a pretty good selection of fabrics and elastic for all different kinds of people -- from plain gray to fishes, plaids, grateful dead, rainbows, flowers, and more. They are quilting cotton on the outside, and muslin cotton on the face side, washable, with a nose wire, and I've rigged an adjustable ear strap with beads. 

I'll never ever love wearing a mask, but I do hate it a little less when it fits my face and looks appealing.

Can I help you hate your mask less? Send me a message.",1

"I'm writing this to hopefully encourage others to visit a STS testing site, even if you don't show any symptoms.

The Marlborough STS site is at the New England Sports center and open 8 am - noon, Monday- Friday. 

When I drove there the signage was a bit unclear -- someone just printed a paper that said ""COVID TESTING"" of something like that with no arrow or directions, but I noticed the parking lot full of cars so I figured that's where it was. Upon arrival someone walks up to you, hands you a form and a pen if you don't have one (bring a pen if you can, it looks like they had a limited number), and then tells you to drive up behind another car. 

I then sat there for 10 minutes until someone came up to me and snapped a photo of my form and ID, and then another 10 minutes until someone handed me a self-admistered testing kit (which also included a pack of 5 KN95 masks). You don't have to ""tickle the brain""; they just instruct you to push the swab into your nostrils and spin it around a few times, and be careful not to touch the soft part of the swab with your fingers to avoid contaminating it. 

After I finished I had to wait another 10 minutes for someone to collect it and then navigate through the maze of parked cars to get out of there. There wasn't really any clear system for the flow of people. 

I got my results 18 hours later. I didn't have to show any insurance information or pay anything.

"Boston is already brutal in the winter. And now a pandemic.

"So we moved to boston a couple of years ago and we didn’t need heating before. When we moved into this house we realized one of the rooms didn’t have a heating vent. It did have one of those board heaters but when we used it for a mont, the bill was wayy too high, higher than the rest of the rooms. So during the winter we stopped using the room. I don’t want to do that anymore. I do use a small heater but it only heats the room for a little bit. Is there anything i can do? was i using the heater wrong, or can i tell the home owner to put a vent in the room. It snowed today so the room is freezing.",1

They’ve taken it seriously, and are far from anti-maskers. They say I should come, get a test and quarantine until I get the result.

I say it’s safer if I just stay home this year.

I know it was a dry cured and pressed sausage. It was also pretty much black in color. It wasn't the most appealing looking food I've ever eaten -it kinda looked like a dried out turd on a bad stretch of road- but I really miss it and if anyone here can help me out with a recipe I'd appreciate it.

According to the [Active COVID Clusters by Exposure Setting Type](https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-covid-19-public-health-report-october-29-2020/download) page from the new report he mentioned, the numbers are that **6830** cases were from ""Household infection"" (two people living in the same house with no other cluster) and **67** cases were from Social Gatherings. 

There only appears to be exposure setting data about clusters in this report, not isolated infections, but it's staggering how misleading his comments are if this is the data he is referring to. Especially since 70 cases were clustered to restaurants and 70 to child care.

"I just won the bid on my first home purchase, near Boston, MA.

I have an attorney, who I picked based on my Agent's recommendation (redfin), and he had good reviews online.

I have no idea how to pick a lender. Ofcourse I will shop around for the best rates and fees, but what else should i be looking for?

I have heard some of the big banks like bofa, wells fargo, quicken loans, are terrible with their service. But once i have the papers signed, what service do i need apart from just making my monthly payments? Are smaller local banks really much better?

I am planning to go for a 30 year fixed mortgage on a jumbo loan, to lock in the low rates. And I want the lowest possible rate, but i don't care too much about a couple of hundred bucks here and there in fees.

My agent told me he always uses one particular lender who does a good job. That is at US Bank which i don't know anything about except that it is a big national bank with apparently a local presence. My attorney, told me to go with someone at Eastern Bank, which is local to the area, and he says they are great specifically for jumbo loans, and that he's worked with them a lot and they do a great job.

The person at Eastern Bank offered me a rate 0.25% lower than what US Bank offered. But my agent said to shop around for rates, and bring it back to the guy at US Bank and he will match it.

Its been hard to find good reviews on either institution, or any other institution, so i dunno how to go about finding a lender. Should I do some research online (please point me to some good resources, when i google it, i see the notorious banks like bofa and quicken as top rated), and then just pick whatever looks the best?

Or should I pick one of the two recommended lenders, in which case should i go with the agent's recommendation or the attorney's recommendation?

We are signing the purchase agreement on friday so i need to lock in a lender soon.

"Hi Everyone – I am hoping if you guys could please lay out some pointers to help me make my decision.

Story:

I am from Calgary, Canada. I have a job offer from Boston. 

Currently I am a Sr. IT Consultant for a Healthcare provider and the new job offer is for IT Manager in a Healthcare step up in Boston.

Salary – There is a decent difference of about $27K if I compare dollar for dollar (Difference of $70K Canadian $, If I apply conversion).   
But I won't do conversion for rest of the post, since I will be spending in USD.

Salary gap is good, however, when I calculate taxes and deductibles – 

· Taxes – Boston has a higher tax (over 27%) from my current (approx. 22%)

· Rental - is expensive – I pay $1000 for a 1BDR. I am assuming it would be $1800 (at least)

· Pension – I currently pay 10% (they pay 15%). For the new job, if I pay 6%, the employer will match 4.5% (403-B)

· Vacation – Current Vacation – 5 weeks (6 weeks next April) vs 3 Weeks (For the new Job)

When I take all this into consideration - I don’t think I am saving more than $10-12K. I think it is little low for a big move. However, I do get promoted.

Weather – Calgary vs Boston – Both are cold, average snowfall has a difference of about 7-10 cms (i.e. Yearly Avg - Boston receives about 2 inches less snowfall than Calgary)  
 Both are cold and experience all 4 seasons. However, Calgary often doesn’t always get Red colour in Autumn/Fall.

It randomly applied for this job, I didn’t know Boston was that cold (sorry I don’t know much about the city.) I want to go to a hotter city. I am done with snow.

**The reason for the post:**

I am hoping if you can give me Boston advantages over other cities or Why should anyone move to Boston? YouTube videos aren’t very helpful.

I am feeling a wee bit guilty that I am comprising too much to get out - The reason I say this because I am very comfortable in my job, I do things according to the way I want, I can take vacation anytime, my team is happy, they like me and vice versa. Also, my boss is amazing, he likes me and so I. Only reason I am quitting because our salaries are under freeze since May-2018.

**TLDR**; Canadian with a job offer from Boston is confused because Salary difference isn’t huge and would want to know why Boston’s advantageousness over other cities.",1
"Boyfriend and I are planning to drive up to Boston from New Haven, CT for a 3 days during Thanksgiving week. We're debating whether to stay at a hotel with free parking in one of the outskirt towns, and then drive into the city... or is it better to stay in the city (we're thinking South End area) and pay for overnight parking? Mind you, we're on budget but I think we could stand to stay in the city if the convenience outweighs the cost. 

Also please share any other things to consider. Like, if we stayed in South End, could we possibly park outside of Boston for cheap and conveniently take bus/ train to our destination/ get around using public transport and rideshare?

Thanks!",1
"Anyone else notice the fireworks repeatedly being set off near the Museum of Fine Arts??  I live in a high rise in fenway looking over the fens, so I see and hear them every time.

"I don't understand, why would we want ranked choice voting (question 2)?..

From ballotpedia: RCV is a voting method in which voters rank candidates according to their preferences. If a candidate receives greater than 50% of all first-preference votes, the candidate is declared the winner and the tabulation ends. If no candidate receives a simple majority of first-preference votes, then the candidate receiving the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. First-preference votes cast for the eliminated candidate are eliminated, and the second-preference choices indicated on those ballots are tallied as their first-preference in the following round.

So IF there's a two way (or more) tie and a third (or more) candidate(s) that is clearly not the winner, they count all the 2nd votes off of all the ballots that chose the loser as their first choice and apply those 2nd votes to the tied candidates?

Is that the only way this would play out? Do we really need to change the way we vote because of this? Does it happen that often that we have a two(+) way tie among three(+) candidates?",1

**Charlie's monologue**

- We've seen a significant increase in the number of people below 30 testing positive
- The most vulnerable residents (i.e. older people) are making up fewer of the new cases, which is a good thing
    - We've improved nursing home measures against the virus
- We will be publishing more data on clusters and where new data is coming from out this week (on Thursday).
- Over half of new cases are spread from household transmission and social gatherings
    - Local officials report that household gatherings and parties are happening more often indoors as the weather cools.
    - People need to stop hosting big parties.
    - Organized, structured, outdoor Halloween activities are far safer than indoor get-togethers
- Youth sports need to recognize and respect the virus
    - We've discovered 110+ cases, 22+ probable cases related to ice hockey in 66 cities and towns
    - These issues with hockey are happening in other states as well
    - Most teams would not make rosters available and were generally hostile to the contact tracers
    - For this reason (among others), we have immediately shut down all hockey rinks for 2 weeks
    - Its not clear if the spread is because of hockey itself, or because of the activities around it (get-togethers, hanging out at the rinks, etc.)
    - Youth hockey needs to make some changes. We look forward to working with them to do so.
- The data is clear: most of the spread is from informal social gatherings.
- We urge people to participate in socially distanced events instead of dangerous close-contact gatherings
    - Unlike the spring, people have a lot of options to do activities that are proven to be safe.
- With thanksgiving coming up, the Mass dept. of public health (MDPH) has released guidelines for how to enjoy thanksgiving safely.
    - They recommend gathering only with immediate family
    - If you do bring guests over (which isn't recommended), only invite guests who are part of your regular social circle who you already interact with regularly

**Secretary Souter's monologue**
- November and December have a lot of holiday gatherings
    - But gathering inside with multiple generations coming and going is the worst case scenario as far as gatherings go.
- The MDPH recommends celebrating with only your immediate family or hosting a virtual celebration.
    - If you decide to invite other members of your family (which isn't recommended), then keep your gatherings small, wear masks when you aren't eating, open doors and windows to allow ventilation, try to do activities outside, and get tested.
    - Consider if the risk of COVID is worth inviting over family members.
- Yesterday, we reported 1,216 new positive cases
    - 25 -&gt; long-term care
    - 25 -&gt; higher ed. testing
    - 34 -&gt; places of worship
    - 36 -&gt; known clusters (including social clubs)
    - 538 -&gt; associated with the 19 highest-risk communities
    - 598 -&gt; We don't yet know where these cases are from. Contact tracers are getting in touch.
- We see clusters emerge from two main settings:
    - Social or private clubs, and
    - places of worship
- We will be revising the COVID dashboard next week
    - We will be giving more info out about clusters

**Questions for Charlie and Secretary Sudders**

- Reporter: Are we at the beginning of a second surge?
- Charlie: We said that we were going to see an increase of cases starting in the fall, and indeed we are. We have far more information available now about where these clusters are coming from. An important differentiation with the last surge is that the demographics of the new positive tests are flipped: it's now mostly younger people getting the virus.

- R: Its been reported that [the state cannot find the source of 50% of new cases](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/source-infections-unknown-half-mass-covid-19-cases-state-says/). Is this true?
- C: It's not that we don't know the source, its that they aren't affiliated with a particular cluster. Additionally, most younger people who catch COVID don't really get sick, which makes it much harder to contact trace.

- R: You've been talking about gatherings for months and months. But these days, we're hearing about new parties shutting down schools, etc. all the time. Does this show that people in their 30s aren't listening to you?
- C: Yes, a lot of these people are throwing parties and gathering, but they're also getting tested. They're getting the message that if you're going to an event with a lot of strangers, you should get tested afterward. But we would rather they not go to these gatherings in the first place.

- R: Is the surge gonna get worse?
- C: It depends on how we as a state choose to respond to it. For example if people decide to hold Halloween parties, that will make the surge get worse.

- R: You've expressed faith that people would follow the guidance, so you generally haven't made any mandates. Based on the behavior of people at sporting events, has your faith been shaken?
- C: We have made some rules, and if you don't follow them then the ABCC (alcoholic beverages control commission) will fine you. But my faith in people has not been shaken. I get the fact that this has been going on for a long time, and people are hungry for physical presence. But there are important things we need to do to let people work, like wearing masks, socially distancing, not having parties. Its very important to me that we respect the people who will not be able to work if we have to shut down again.

- R: You've been an advocate for kids being in school. Would you agree that towns moving into the red zone should be shutting down their schools?
- C: The town of Marblehead shut down schools for 2 weeks after a party because they didn't know who had gone to that party. However the town of Swampscott (which is a red town) recently switched from remote to hybrid because there is very little evidence that the virus spreads in schools.
- C: The parochial schools are some of the best active evidence of how to open schools in-person safely. These schools are mostly in red zones, serve 30K students, but have reported just 25 cases since mid-august. I would argue that the structure, rules, and guidance made available to schools makes it possible for kids to go to school. In my mind, its not clear that being at home is any safer (because students might be spending that time hanging out without masks).

- R: Milton found some cases at the high school. Do you think Milton is mistaken in where these cases are from? [I couldn't quite hear this question]
- C: People need to look at several weeks worth of data and make decisions based on what that data says. If you have 3+ reporting periods where your town is red, you should start thinking about remote options. But otherwise, you should consider about having school in person.

- R: In June, you laid off a lot of contact tracers. Have you hired any of these people back? If not, do you have the capacity to tackle this current surge?
- Secretary Sudders: Although we did reduce the size of the contact tracing team in June, we increased it again when schools started to reopen. We now have 661 contact tracers on the CTC (community tracing collaborative) side, and we are bringing in about 30-50 new contact tracers per week. Our goal is to have 1 contact tracer for 20 cases, and right now its in the high 20s. However, we have just under 2,000 overall contact tracers.

- R: What did you mean by ""don't share utensils"" in your thanksgiving guidelines?
- Sudders: There should be 1-2 people in the kitchen creating full plates for people and then giving those plates to each person at the dining table. Also, don't steal food off of people's plates.

- R: Do you have any guidance for college students coming home for thanksgiving?
- Sudders: We certainly don't want to see college students spending thanksgiving completely alone in their dorms. But if you are coming from a [high-risk state](https://i.imgur.com/zjToVEI.png), you will need to quarantine for 2 weeks or produce a negative test.

- R: Has there been a reluctance from some groups to cooperate with the contact tracers?
- Sudders: The MDPH has 13 epidemiologists investigating clusters in Massachusetts. When dealing with hockey-related clusters, they encountered instances of (1) coaches not sharing rosters, (2) coaches instructing parents to not cooperate with contact tracers, (3) coaches who indicated that quarantine meant that you were still allowed to play on other teams, just not your current team. We are currently developing rules to allow hockey to reopen safely.

- R: Will the new rules for hockey be mandates, or just guidelines?
- Sudders: They will be mandates. If you don't cooperate with the contact tracers, we will shut down your rink or team.

- R: Is there any indication from the MDPH how close we are to an antibody test? [an antibody test shows if you've already had the virus]
- Sudders: No. We're focused on PCR tests right now. [A PCR test shows if you currently have the virus and usually takes a day or two for the results to get back to you]. However, we are currently doing sensitivity testing with the Abbott Binax tests which are point-of-care antigen tests [An antigen test will detect if you currently have the virus but is much faster than a PCR test, as short as 15 minutes]. If you go to a free testing site in Lawrence, your sample will be tested on both a PCR test and on an antigen test to determine the sensitivity of the antigen tests. If it has the sensitivity that we hope it has, then we will be deploying these tests more widely.

- R: You talked about people needing to work. With cases surging, how long does it have to get if people don't listen to your pleas and cases continue to rise?
- C: We would be pursuing targeted interventions to shut down only activities where clusters are common. We started using this mass alert on people's phones in order to let people in red communities know that there's a lot of COVID in their area.

- R: Do you envision a situation like going back to March/April?
- C: In March and April, we had very little testing and basically no data. That's not where we are now.

- R: Are there clusters connected to work?
- C: There are some. There will be more info out in the coming weekly report.

- R: How are you thinking about voting in the upcoming election?
- C: I will be voting no on question 2 (ranked choice voting) because its too complicated. I will be voting for Kevin O'Connor (Ed Markey's opponent). I will not be voting for the president.

- R: Will the election be a turning point for this pandemic? [I didn't quite hear this question]
- C: I hope so. The turnout was high for the primary because people believe there's a lot at stake. A lot being at stake means people have heightened emotions, which are only exacerbated by some of the recent news. The people's will needs to be pursued. Post election, we're still going to have to deal with COVID and all the other issues we've been discussing, but hopefully people will be more focused on fighting the pandemic once the election is over.",1

"Hello! Odd question that I'm not quite sure this is the right place for, but I can't get it out of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was on a walk to grab some tea yesterday (The 24th), and somewhat near Northeastern University I passed this girl on the sidewalk. She was kind of hunched up and doing this odd bent over thing ( Best way I can describe it is the Uttanasana yoga pose lol ) and she looked like she was in general distress. I sort of assumed she was having a panic attack of some sort and didn't want to approach her. 

About ten minutes later I was heading back and she was gone, but I saw her a few minutes later again stumbling across the street, and when she got to the sidewalk in the middle of the road (Where the T is) she started doing the bent over thing again. She looked really unbalanced and I was worried she was gonna fall into traffic, so I called the police because I had literally no idea what else to do. I was told that there were already police on the way so I went home. 

Weird thing is she just looked like some college girl, and i've never really seen anyone act like that before. She was stumbling a lot like a super drunk person would, but the bending over was real strange. Not to mention it was the middle of the day (around four) . 

There was a lot of people around so I'm hoping maybe someone here either saw the outcome or heard something about it? I haven't been able to stop thinking about it last night!

"i'm hearing horror stories about people not receiving any aid and being unemployed (through no fault of their own) in other states, especially florida. i belong to a nation-wide support group for spa workers and massage therapy. i worked part-time, 15/hrs, week, and take care of a family (all adults). my earnings were low ($15k/yr), but we often got cash tips from customers who appreciated the personal service ($5k/yr), and i had regulars with chronic conditions that were kept out of the hospital by getting weekly massage. i developed friendships with my clients, and i miss them, and i've heard they miss me. anyway, 

after furlough in march, i am still unable to go back to work, for safety reasons. my employer (who is frugal) claimed i quit when she reopened for the hair salon in june, but no massage therapy people returned. 

i got a very polite call from the the UI office, and they explained i needed a letter from my doctor, who supplied said letter in 24 hrs, which i uploaded, and they confirmed. a week later, i just got a nice letter back saying that i was approved for ongoing UI (at $143/week) and my employer's statement that i ""quit"" was denied.

**Staying Warm:**

\-if you rent, your landlord is required to pay for your heating unless your rental agreement clearly states otherwise. Landlords who provide heat must keep your unit between 68F and78F during daytime hours and at least 64F overnight. [Details here.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/massachusetts-landlord-and-tenants-duties.aspx) 

\-If you rent but pay for heat OR are a homeowner, you can apply for fuel assistance if your household income is less than $65,008. Fuel assistance is done by towns rather than at the state level, and payments start Nov 1. [Details here](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/apply-for-home-heating-and-energy-assistance) and [some other details](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/when-am-i-protected-from-having-my-utilities-shut-off) about not getting gas/water/electricity shut off. 

\-Because again, I am a transplant from the south, I'm not going to try to make extended recommendations on winter gear. But I've stocked up on sweaters (thrifted from Goodwill in Davis mostly), socks, a pair of good quality gloves, some baselayers, boots, an insulated hat, and a quality heating pad. My partner bought a waterproof, insulated ground blanket so that we can sit outside without the cold seeping in. I've seen a lot of (apparently) quality coats for sale on deep discount on Facebook Marketplace. 

**Staying Sane &amp; Healthy:**

\-We're going to have less total sunlight per day, but sunlight continues to be pretty important for at minimum \[quality\] sleep and probably mood. I'm lucky enough to keep working, and my current process is to set an alarm to remind myself to walk at lunchtime. If I didn't, I would go to work and leave work in the dark.

[Details about how to think about this if you do long hours shift work](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/light.html).

\-If you can't regularly get outside, or are really sensitive to the cold, [maybe try a sun lamp](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-sun-lamps-best-to-improve-your-winter-mood/)? 

\-If you live or work anywhere in MA and have an email address, you can sign up online for [a Boston Public Library e-card](https://www.bpl.org/ecard/), with no in-person setup required. 99% of what I read and watch comes from this system, and it's great. 

\-If we close down again, I'm expecting some up-close medical stuff to be unavailable. If you can, this might be a good time to do any preventative dental cleanings, eye checks, etc you could need in the next six months.

"Some folks on the Reddit Discord channel decided to place a friendly wager of Reddit gold to see who can guess when Boston's first snowfall will be.

#[Tallying guesses here:](https://forms.gle/4YHU56v5tQ9vYqVj8) 

• Users may choose one date to predict when Boston will receive its first snowfall.

• Snowfall must be officially recognized by a major weather reporting institution (u/RyanKinder counts, obviously)

• Users who correctly predict the date of first snowfall will be awarded Reddit Platinum - *such wow!*

• If no users correctly predict the date of first snowfall, users who are closest will be awarded Reddit Gold - *wow!*

      ○ ""Closest"" can be before or after the date of snow. *Example: Two days before or two days afterwards. However, in the event multiple users select two days before snowfall and two days after snowfall, users who selected the date that has not past will win. Consider this ""reverse Price Is Right"" rules.*

• Multiple users may win. This is just for fun.

"So I’d just like to say first that I fully support BPS taking the safe approach to keep kids and teachers healthy... but if case finding is too high for the essential service of public education... WHY is Mayor Walsh keeping bars and restaurants open where people are crowded together (social distancing to the absolute minimum extent if at all) with NO MASKS?? 


Are we just magically expecting cases to go down here? Is going to a restaurant more important than educating kids? The remote option is the best one right now but it’s not even close to ideal with how many kids aren’t even logging on. The Mayor needs to be making it a priority to get cases down so schools can open.",1

"Why is no one else talking about this? 

I don’t have as much of a problem with restaurants, salons, etc. remaining at a 25 person cap because at least they are TRYING (and for the most part doing a good job) of following guidelines for social distancing, masks, and sanitizing. 

Yet on the other hand, you have 20-30 kids in their 20’s pilling into apartments and small homes every weekend, without masks, not following social distancing guidelines, and without a care in the world for COVID. It’s ridiculous, but I don’t blame kids in their 20’s for being kids in their 20’s. 

My issue is with the state and city for allowing this ridiculously high cap. There is absolutely NO reason why there should ever be 20+ people cramped into apartments in the middle of a pandemic. It’s a fucking joke and I’m tired of watching our local businesses go under because our leaders have their head up their ass and allow shit like this to continue.",1

"Yesterday was trash pickup in my neighborhood. Around 9am, I dragged my trash and recycle bins to the curb. When I got home, the barrels were not at the bottom of my driveway like they usually leave them. I found my recycle bin a couple doors down and across the street, but was unable to locate my trash bin. I walked up and down both sides of the block, peeking into side yards, but it was nowhere to be found. I even asked a few people who I saw out on the street, but they didn't notice anything. I texted my landlord about what happened and waited for their reply.

This evening, she texted me back that ""tenants are responsible for lost trash bins"" and she would be charging me $85 for a new one. She also tried to imply that maybe I left it sitting on the curb for too long and maybe that's why it's missing. I reminded her that yesterday was trash pickup and that I had texted her after trying to locate it when I got home from work. It's unreasonable to expect me to come home during the middle of the work day to monitor my trash bins, and besides, I've never had trouble before. I put them on the curb before work and I drag them back to their spot at the other end of the driveway when I get home. I only work 8 hours, totally normal.

I decided to do a little research and found some information on [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/doc/105-cmr-410-state-sanitary-code-chapter-ii-minimum-standards-of-fitness-for-human-habitation/download) regarding the Dept. of Public Health, specifically 410.600(C) which states, ""The owner of any dwelling that contains three or more dwelling units, the owner of any rooming house, and the occupant of any other dwelling place shall provide as many receptacles for the storage of garbage and rubbish as are sufficient to contain the accumulation before final collection or ultimate disposal, and shall locate them so as to be convenient to the tenant and so that no objectionable odors enter any dwelling."" This leads me to believe that my landlord needs to procure and provide the trash bin, even though it states in my lease that the tenant is responsible. I'm pretty sure things that are illegal and/or in violation of codes are not enforceable in any lease or contract.

So, r/boston, what's the verdict here? Thanks in advance...I appreciate you all.",1

"NYE 2012: One of the few years I've been popular enough to have multiple plans. I had 4 different tentative plans that night, all with queer men. In my mind I referred to them as ""the four homos of the apocalypse."" (I'm a queer woman). I think this was the first NYE after I broke up with my girlfriend. First I went to the party of a guy who I used to work with, bringing along with me a friend. Said friend was more bi than I had realized, and at the first party I went to, told me he had a crush on me. We went to a second party, all homos (I have never felt less interesting to a room full of people), where he kissed me on the cheek at midnight. I left him in a sea of muscular dudes and took a cab to Club Café to meet up with homo #3 (homo #4 wisely decided to stay in). The vibe at Club Café was weird and desperate. I made out with a woman I'd just met for the first time in my life, and hated it. On the dance floor, another woman started feeling me up and trying to make out with me until I pushed her off me. I stopped dancing after that. My friend said ""Have you ever made out with a gay man?"" I told him no, and I didn't want to. Finally, I left the club. My head hurt, and I had come to the realization that New Year's craziness is no fun. Out on the street, a young, short Black man was shivering and trying to hail a cab. He had no jacket, and this was Boston winter. No cabs stopped. He told me he'd come to the club with some lesbian friends who had borrowed, and gone home with, his coat, which had his wallet and phone in the pocket. I said we could take the cab together and split the fair. The cab dropped us off in Central Square, where I'd left my car. But I couldn't find it. The cab wasn't taking credit cards, and I had just enough cash (or maybe less?) to get us to the street I was pretty sure my car was on. I had to kind of beg the driver to take us around a little bit to look for a car. I remember the guy I was with wanted to write for tv. He was either working on some scripts or just dreaming about breaking into tv writing somehow.  He loved Roseanne (this was before she was evil). He was just nice, and was unfazed by my inability to find my own car as we walked around the bitterly cold streets. At one point, we stepped over a giant white feather, and I thought, that's a sign. This is good. I had never dated a cis man before, but I was beginning to think about maybe trying it. We finally found my car and I drove him home. He said ""I'd love to text you sometime,"" and I gave him my number. I went home, slept badly. The next morning, I realized I left my phone in the cab. I couldn't remember which cab company it was, but I called a few. It took a few days to replace it. If I did indeed get any text messages during that time, I never received them. So I don't know if he texted me. But every so often I remember that very weird New Year's in which more happened in one night than usually happens to me in months. I wonder what, if anything, would have happened if I hadn't lost my phone.",1

I currently live in central Florida and will be starting at the University  of Massachusetts online in the Spring of 2021.

"I was leaving the Racepoint visitor lot last weekend before a man with binoculars yelled at me and told me he could see Boston.  I told him Boston would be more to the left (NW), but then I looked at what he pointed to and there *were* buildings visible with the naked eye. 

Luckily I had my Nikon P900 which has an 83x optical zoom to get a closer look. The buildings didn’t look like Boston to me, but the only other options I could think of were Portsmouth, NH or Portland, ME.  Portland is much further away so that presents a problem.

"Has anyone been to this gym? I moved to Boston last fall and did not join a gym before COVID hit, and I'm looking for places to potentially join once things are safer. I've read some good things about The Ring and I think it might fit what I'm looking for, but I'd appreciate any insight!

For context, I am not very fit and am looking to get more in shape. I used to go to an ILoveKickboxing before I moved, and I liked the workout but did not like their attitude toward food/dieting and the way they'd offer unsolicited advice on that topic (fine if you want it, but I did not need to be told to only eat a quarter of a mango so I didn't have too much sugar).

I'm looking for a place where I can do group classes and a boxing-type workout because I feel like I need the structure of someone leading my workout. However, I don't want the atmosphere to be too intense. As someone looking to get back into working out at a gym, some boxing clubs are really intimidating to me. It's also a plus if they have classes offered at a variety of hours. In non-COVID times I work relatively long hours and need to be able to take some classes at 6:30 or 7 pm.

Thanks in advance!",1
" From the BPS Superintendent's Email:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Dear Boston Public Schools Community:
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) released data showing the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate increased to 5.7%. This is an increase from 4.5% last week and from 4.1% two weeks before.
&gt; 
&gt; Current data are showing a concerning upward trend of COVID-19 activity in the City of Boston and, out of an abundance of caution, Mayor Walsh and I have decided to suspend in-person learning for all students. Effective tomorrow, Thursday, October 22, all BPS students will learn remotely until public health data shows a downward trend in positive COVID-19 cases.
&gt; 
&gt; We remain committed to providing in-person learning opportunities to our students as soon as it is safe to do so, and will continue to prioritize our students with the highest needs for in-person learning. Once the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate is below 5% for two consecutive weeks, we will begin to welcome our students with the highest needs back for in-person learning. When the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate is below 4% for two consecutive weeks, we will restart the phase-in of in-person learning beginning with our youngest students.
&gt; 
&gt; Some families received communication within the last week notifying them of their child’s in-person start date. That information has now unfortunately changed due to this news. All BPS students will learn remotely effective Thursday, October 22. We will provide you with any update to our plans as soon as they develop. In addition, schools will work with families who may need to pick up technology or other personal items students may have left at school. We are also exploring options for providing services for our students with complex disabilities and will update families with more information in the coming days.
&gt; 
&gt; The City of Boston has increased testing efforts and outreach to impacted neighborhoods. More information about COVID-19, including testing sites and community resources, is available boston.gov/coronavirus. For more information about remote learning, technology resources and free meal sites, visit bostonpublicschools.org/reopening.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that these are uncertain times. I thank you again for your patience, flexibility, and collaboration as we all work to provide enriching learning experiences for our students during this challenging time. Stay safe and healthy.
&gt; 
&gt; All my best,
&gt; ​​​​​​​

Am I still eligible to receive unemployment? It's my understanding you have to actively apply to maintain benefits but obviously I wouldn't be doing that since I already have a job.

If anybody has been in a similar situation or is more knowledgeable on the subject then myself it would be a great help to get some information. 

Thank you",1

At the risk of very, very few people understanding what this is, I would like to present 'THE FiERCE BRooD', an actual play role-playing experience every Wednesday (tonight!) at 8 PM on my YouTube channel. If you take the roleplaying game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and then cross it with historical, true-to-life Boston in 1918 and fictional, supernatural horrors, then you'd have the basic idea of what we're doing. Roleplaying is basically a group storytelling game in which players, led by a narrator (referred to as the Game Master), make up a story together.

**'THE FiERCE BRooD’ is an otherworldly, cosmic horror roleplay adventure set in Boston in 1918, at the height of the influenza pandemic and end of the Great War. As our Player Characters discover, however,** ***there are other worlds than these..!***

With each episode of **'THE FiERCE BRooD'**, we blend actual events, notable locations, and important figures of the time with fiction. Exploring historic Boston and the surrounding areas, the *dramatis personae* confront ancient monsters of legend and make horrific discoveries that call into question humanity's place in the universe.

If a cocktail of equal parts Stephen King, David Cronenberg, and HP Lovecraft mixed with two parts accurate history sounds like your kind of drink, give us a try. **‘THE FiERCE BRooD’** is a roleplaying experiment that educates and enlightens as much as it entertains and engages.

# Watch us live on YouTube every Wednesday (tonight!) at 8 PM EDT / 5 PM PDT and be sure to look out for a few noteworthy cameos that should interest horror fans, in general, and Cthulhu fans, specifically.",1
"I recently received a warrant to collect an excise tax from the city of Brookline where I have an apartment... Bit of backstory I purchased my vehicle last Oct in MA and the vehicle was originally registered to my MA address. However, my official domicile is my home back in Maine. As a result when I went back to Maine for extended period of time in April I re-registered it there and paid the full excise tax there ($800). 

Now the town of Brookline has sent me this notice demanding $700. I recently lost my job and cannot afford to pay the additional $700 plus it seems ridiculous that I should have to pay over $1500 in total excise taxes. The letter also threatens to block registration with the RMV. However since both my registration/license are in ME are there other negative consequences of simply not paying them?",1

Would prefer to do the interview in person, but I can do Zoom.  Masked and socially distanced of course!  Let me know if interested!",1

"Been living in Boston for a few years now and I've been trying to go zero waste. I've been able to find Cleenland in Central for body/home products, and Cambridge Naturals for spices, but I can't find regular groceries sold package free. Farmers markets were a great place to shop, but those are coming to a close with winter coming. Does anyone know of good ways to get grocery staples without the packaging?

If someone was thinking of starting one of these stores, I'll be your first customer!

"I’m so so so sorry for the way the hospital ER handled that. The lack of empathy shown by the staff at mount auburn hospital during that shift or those several hours or whatever was shocking. Clearly, they’ve lost their humanity or are not properly trained. I’m sorry I didn’t try harder to help you- I wanted to ask you if you wanted to go outside or for a walk, but I also understand that for a lot of people, a large tattooed man is not who they need assistance from in that situation. You did the right thing leaving. I only wished I followed you out and told you such, and gave you/ordered you a ride away from there to wherever you needed to go. If you by chance see this, feel free to DM me. They made you feel alone, but you’re not, and I’m happy to be a friend. And I get it, I fully get it. 

Sorry for the rant, but I’m really ashamed by what I saw today.",1
"I was worried about potentially long lines and long turnaround times for test results, so I just wanted to share my experience here in case it helps anyone else looking to get tested.

I got tested at Florence Street Park in Everett on Monday morning. No registration needed, you just walk up to the tent outside. This is a Stop the Spread site, so completely free for Massachusetts residents. They don’t ask for any insurance info and you don’t need symptoms to get tested.

The test site opened at 7 am. I arrived around 7:15 and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me. They hadn’t actually started testing people yet. Once they got going it was taking 1-2 minutes per person. I was out of there a little after 7:45. When I went there was plenty of free parking available on Florence Street.

Results were promised in 24-48 hours. I got my results by email just 13 hours after my test (negative!). Overall I was really pleased with the testing site and would go there again if I had to get tested. 

Note this site is only open Mondays 7 am-noon, but the same provider operates [various testing sites](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/stop-the-spread) around Everett Monday-Saturday.",1

"When the pandemic hit...as many of you know...BSC tried to put us on some virtual plan. I responded by saying I was not interested and to cancel my account. I also blocked my credit card at the bank level. This summer they tried to restart everyone and, again, I said ""no."" But never heard anything back. Today I received an email saying my account was three months overdue (apparently the bank block worked) and was being sent to collections. Is there anything I can do?

I did consider this might be a scammer...but it is so hard to tell the difference between a hardworking scammer and a normal BSC employee.

This is totally disregarding my train and hotel cancelation policies.  My friend went up there without completing this service, as well as a couple of his friends, but they were traveling by car. So my question is who is checking for the test and where do they expect me to go to get results for my visit?",1

Well lads,

I'm trying to immerse myself a bit more with Irish Americans, so learning a little bit about them. Ireland is hoping on a Biden win as you can imagine as he has made some comments in support of Ireland with regards to the whole Brexit deal and how it would affect peace in Northern Ireland - basically encouraging Britain to keep to it's commitments as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement. The Irish value the link it has with America.

This may sound like a dumb question but I'll fire away anyway. Is the whole Irish thing still big in Boston? 

I've heard that South Boston would be more Irish and I've heard terms like Southies etc? Do you ever get a feeling that you're in an Irish neighborhood?

Anyway if you give me a sense of what it's like I'd be curious to know! straight from the source is best. If you got any questions about Ireland I'd be happy to answer too.

Anyways, the examiner told me to wait two weeks before I could do it again but the next available appointment isn't all the way to Dec 16. I scheduled on that day anyways so I could secure a spot but is there any way I could find another appointment possibly even earlier?

"Been trying to get an appointment for over two weeks now. They're booking 60 days in advance, all unavailable. The next date to become available never happens at the same time -- sometimes it seems to be midnight, other times 3AM, other times later. 

I leave my computer for less than a couple minutes, I come back and the booking has opened up only for every single appointment to be taken at every single RMV in literally two or three minutes. I spent over nine hours today refreshing every minute or two...I end up pulling it up on my phone too because I had to leave the computer, turns out the day was already booked and every time I refreshed the tab on my computer it apparently wasn't actually refreshing the scheduling part properly. It takes a good minute to put in all the info to sign in, if I were to re sign in every time I want to properly refresh I'll just miss it again.

So for anyone who's managed to get an appointment with these people, how'd you do it? Are they sending out a text when it becomes available or something? Would calling help at all? Thanks.",1

"So..... I was issued a ticket north of Boston but still in Boston. I am from out of state but was living there for a couple of months for work. I was never able to find the ticket on the website to pay for it so I just assumed the cop never entered it. I even got a cop friend to check the database and he couldn't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the problem. Last month Massachusetts sent something to the state of Alabama where I am from that I have an unpaid ticket and they suspended my license. I have been trying to contact the RMV every day for over a month. When I call theres 200+ people already on the phone before me. I have a very busy time ahead of me and I cant sit on the phone for 6 hours waiting. What can I do to fix this. I still have the physical ticket and the address that he wrote on the ticket to mail it to me is not my address. I guess thats why I never got anything in the mail about it. The state of Alabama says they cannot reinstate my license until Massachusetts reinstates me (thats stupid considering I have an Alabama license).

&amp;#x200B;

Who can I call? I cant do the reinstate payment on the website because it just gives me an error on my social and birthdate and all of that. This is very embarrassing and extremely infuriating.

&amp;#x200B;

It also doesn't give me a way to put in a call back number. I have been calling 857.368.8000

&amp;#x200B;

Also as backed up as the RMV is they should not be allowed to close at 5pm they should have an all night crew. Its pathetic they'll never catch up and now I'm stuck with no license and I drive for work every single day",1

What other romantic proposal/date itineraries might be a good idea? A coworker recommended Barcelona Wine Bar in the South End. I know that area is very pretty but I don't know much else about it. Perhaps something in Cambridge or a nice dim sum and Chinese bakery brunch date too!

"I live in the North End and I am wondering how likely it would be that the landlord would be able to find a new tenant right now. It seems like the realtors have been showing other apartments in the building, but I am not sure how much success they have been having since I don’t really know any of my neighbors/talk to anyone in the area. 

I resigned my lease back in the Spring for a September 1st lease, and I have been regretting it every single day since the end of summer. I work 70 hours a week (from home) in my studio apartment. For the last month or so there has been construction happening on the street next to me that has led to the sounds of drilling and hammering all day long. After that, there are only a few quiet hours before my neighbors, a few floors up, host large get togethers that are noisy into the early AM hours (at least 3-4 days a week).

On top of all that, trying to find parking in the North End is awful. Between the construction vehicles taking up spots over night, pop up outdoor restaurants taking up spaces, and all the non resident parked cars (who never seem to get ticketed), it takes an average of 30min-45min to find a spot. It’s fucking awful.

As I write this, my neighbors (who don’t appear to be doing anything wrong other than hosting a small but very loud get together) are back at it again. I’ve already worked 12 hours today and I’m likely going to be working until sunrise. I can’t take it anymore. Between all the noise, and feeling like these studio walls are caving in on me, I’m at a breaking point. Can someone please offer some advice on how to get out of my living situation?

Reduced the private gathering limit. Revised the rules on gathering at event spaces. They added a mandate that the event venue actually report any infections to the local board of health for contact tracing to reduce super spreading.

Ultimately we shouldn't be looking at any metric in isolation. We should be looking into why the data is showing the things it is and then if it is caused by something controllable then we control that means of infection to reduce the risk.",1

The short (updated) version is that your numerator is positives from new and repeat patients while your denominator is only new patients. That was fine for a long time (few people were tested, so almost every test was a new test anyway). The percentage of tests that were from new patients has steadily ticked down (75% over the summer, 60%ish for early fall, 50% in October) and then fell off a cliff this month to under a third of tests being repeat tests around Thanksgiving (even after I adjust for the higher education tests).

"&gt; Why is the number increasing if we are all doing exactly what we are suppose to be doing?MA has some the strictest rules in all of the US, why is the number increasing?

Because the chance of getting the virus and getting sick is _probabilistic_ in nature. During the summer there was less of a chance to get it, while now there is a higher chance of getting it. In both cases, the probability of getting it was shifted due to a variety of factors (weather, social distancing, strictness of mask wearing, how much time people spent together inside, etc...). I know you're looking for exact, specific, explainable events that have caused increases, but that isn't exactly how illnesses like this virus spread (obviously there are illnesses like norovirus, salmonella, etc. that are pretty specific, but this is not one of those viruses). 

Whether someone gets it relies on a joint probability of _many_ factors, and enumerating them is kind of pointless. Tell me, why do you think the regular flu has way more cases in the winter than in the summer? I've known people who got the flu in the summer - it's not impossible at all, it's just a matter of probability.",1

"&gt; Seems the wait time is quite variable.

We've discussed test delays previously in these threads and one of the things that's been suggested is that the testing companies are pooling samples. So, test 20 people together and, if the batch is negative, then they're all negative. If the pool comes back positive, put them back in the queue and test them all individually. 

It's possible that she got lumped into a batch of 20 people who were all negative, so she got the quickie all-clear while you got lumped into a batch with a positive, so you get the wait. At this short interval, the difference in your personal risk of being positive isn't really significant (the reported test %positive for tests taken on Sunday has gone from 4% among results reported prior to today up to 4.8% for results reported today), so there's no need for concern. Just curse your bad luck and hope it comes back soon.",1

Those who choose to take it, awesome. Those that don’t because they want to wait to see if there are long term side effects, awesome. The most important part is that a vaccine exists that will prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands.

"Everything shut down for what ... 6 weeks? 10 weeks? People basically had nowhere to go and most did stay home. Let's say that they DID do more. Ok. What is the point? Would that have eradicated the virus? Not even close. 

So... they are ""extra staying home"" for 10 weeks now. No fun time visits to other households. No roomie Friday night parties. Now what? Do you think that could last 12-18 months till the vaccine is easily available? The answer isn't ""no""  - it's ""not even close."" 

After the initial 6 weeks (that's 3x as long as the ""2 weeks"" bullshit"" by the way), they should have opened everything, with masks mandatory only in public transit (yes, that's it, because that's the only place you might not be able to avoid prolonged (&gt;15mins), close range (&lt;6'
) contact * with people without a CHOICE). 

I can't comment on churches and how they are managing capacity...  but... again, these tents aren't spreading the virus, nor are restaurants. It's not a long-range alien virus.  This is suggested from:

"You'll find multiple towns, including Boston, with multiple providers. As I said, it's a matter of profitability, and some towns are worth building by multiple providers. Boston, for example, has a huge transient population - students are willing to switch and sign new agreements each year. This means more customers for providers, and reduces the build cost. Cities are easier to build, in some respects...a provider can add a drop to an apartment complex and net multiple customers off one cable, whereas building a whole suburb development means multiple drops to multiple buildings.  

As for Boston, Comcast has fully built, RCN has decent but unfinished coverage, and Verizon entered the market just a few years ago so their build is ongoing. Starry is not a POTS or cable provider, so it's not obligated to fully build. It doesn't happen overnight, they had to negotiate the areas in which the build occurred.

I can't claim that I am intimately familiar with the COVID-19 vaccine processes that were set by the FDA, and I do believe that the vaccines are most likely both safe and effective given the data coming out of the studies. However, that isn't the same as saying it wasn't rushed. They absolutely were rushed. Mistakes will be made in any medical drug or device development on a normal timeline under the best conditions, and doing so many thing concurrently compounds the issues that lead to those mistakes. 

I want to reiterate, I am absolutely not saying I believe these vaccines are unsafe or ineffective. But anyone familiar with FDA processes should know that the development of these vaccines occurred on a timeline that is conducive to mistakes occurring. Most likely these mistakes will not impact the results of the studies or the development and subsequent manufacturing of the vaccines in meaningful ways, again the data from the studies is very good at this point, but I can assure you the process for the development of these vaccines will have been far from perfect. It is the nature of beast when working on massive projects that are extremely detail oriented with dozens, if not hundreds of people involved (not including test subjects). Thorough audit and review of the development, clinical trials, and manufacturing will have to be performed to double check everything from start to finish, and the best outcome is that they find any mistakes that were made and are able to determine that they did not have any negative impact on the development and subsequent results in the clinical trial.

Several states, including California and New York, are doing independent reviews of the vaccine approvals, which is something I am strongly in favor of. Understanding what occurred during the development, testing, and manufacturing of these vaccines is extremely important and transparency in this will ultimately benefit everyone.",1

"That’s fair, some allergy symptoms don’t overlap (sneezing, itchy eyes). Though I’m seeing plenty of cases with congestion/runny noses that only coincide with their symptomatic period. I’m writing in congestion and runny nose under the free-text “other symptoms” box in the state’s contact tracing system. (I do this under the supervision of a team of MDs who are making the call that yes, these are COVID symptoms.)

I think the issue is the symptom list is long and nonspecific. My official checklist includes fever, difficulty breathing/SOB, chest pain, muscle aches, cough, loss of appetite, loss of taste/smell, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and  “other symptoms” (congestion, runny nose, fatigue, COVID toes, dizziness, etc). All of these symptoms run the range of barely noticeable to severe. The most common symptom among healthier people in our dataset is loss of smell! Couple these symptoms with runaway community spread and it is going to be tough to only test those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath. You’d probably miss the majority of cases in with that strategy.

"Unfortunately the virus doesn't care about whether we're trying our personal best, or how well we can rationalize our actions. It is what it is, and many people hold this attitude in the USA - because we have and (apparently violently demand) the freedom to do so, even at great mortal peril to ourselves. It is the price we pay. Other countries which have been able to control their outbreaks and open up entirely used mandated lockdown methods for a short period of time, and had cultures that value civic and collective responsibility over personal freedom. I am not trying to be cute or cheeky, truly saying, it is what it is and we caused (and continue to cause) this ourselves.",1
States are actively choosing to force businesses to close. That is and has never been the fault or responsibility of the federal government.,1

As for staying in business in MA, I do not go to CFA- not really a fast food fan - though I drive around a drive-thru line that extends onto the street six days a week for nearly six to eight hours a weekday. They look like they are doing fine.

"No, if people misuse testing it will increase the turn around time for symptomatic and exposed testing...which makes contact tracing less useful.",1
"New cases are the raw number of positive tests. Case rate is the percentage of tests that were positive. The number of tests vary by date, so the two could move independently, although they usually don't except in extreme cases like we're seeing right now due to the holiday. 

From a practical standpoint, the percent positive is mostly a QC metric. It tells you if you're testing enough. If you're only testing severely symptomatic people, for instance, almost all of your tests will be positive but you'll also be missing a lot of cases (basically what we saw back in April). As you add in mildly symptomatic and contacts of symptomatic people and contacts of the contacts, etc., you start pulling the percent positive down (less risky populations) even as the number of cases keeps increases (you catch the occasional case you would've missed). You want the positive to be below 5% to say that your positive test number is actually representative of what you see in the population and preferably below 3% to say your contact tracing is working well. 

Massachusetts' numbers are also a little weird because of the high number of colleges, which threw every swab they could find at students and staff. Almost half of our tests during the school year came from higher education, which were very negative as a whole (heavily tested and easily quarantined population), so they're split out as a separate line. When colleges stopped testing (like over the holiday), the total population %positive line spiked closer to the non-higher-ed population %positive line, which is always higher (less tested and harder to control population).",1
"If the federal government hadn't been such a shit show this year we could've had a month lockdown in March and crushed this virus.

"I'm not sure the drill press is the complete answer here.

You want a jig or fixture that can hold your piece firmly while you drill, and that might be the same regardless of whether you're using a handheld or a drill press.

It looks like the wood you want to drill is roughly the dimensions of a chunk of 2""x4"".

Imagine a 4"" cube of wood ( like from a 4""x4"" ).  Cut this in half at a 45 degree angle to form two wedges.  Place one wedge below your workpiece. and one above, and secure this.

Then, you drill straight down through the top wedge and your workpiece, stopping once your bit is into the bottom wedge.  A drill press may help a little, but a handheld will work too - and a drill press without a jig will still be painful.  This approach limits the wandering of the bit.

If I did it in my shop,  I'd table or chop saw the wedges, and then clamp them in place with a couple wood clamps or a vice, and have at it with the drill.

Alternatively, and depending on what type of drill bits you have, you may be able to work your way up - drill a small pilot hole ( like 3/16"" or so ), and the keep increasing the size of the bits - they'll want to follow the existing hold rather than wander off.",1

"My wife was bit in BH, while riding. She confronted the owner who denied it. She showed him the mark on her ankle. He still denied it. I said I saw it. He still denied it.

Another time, riding ahead, my daughter (6) got off her bike, a doberman came out of the woods and locked on her. I maneuvered to get between her and the dog at which point the dog started growling and barking. The owner arrived and started yelling at me to stop scaring her dog, at which point the dog went completely nuts.

On another occasion yet another off leash dog came up to us as we were eating. I asked the owner to call her dog. Her response, he's friendly. I said I don't like dogs (exaggeration). Her response, good luck with that. 

When doing trail patrol (official, volunteer) I've had owners curse and threaten when I simply reminded them that leashes were required in the park.

"Unfortunately it's just not enough. Baker is already pulling $1.35 billion of it for Covid-related measures/expenditures, leaving a balance of $2.1 billion. Put another way, the measures we currently have in place and anticipate putting in place, plus lost tax revenue, is going to cost $1.35 billion - another pseudo-lockdown would probably cost twice that much. There will be further costs down the road, too, for who knows how many years, so we can't empty the fund. 

That said, there are intermediate steps that could be taken. Ask all nonessential employees who can work from home, to do so. If people exercising outdoors now need face coverings, let's require that for people running on a treadmill or whatever now too. Maybe the state could hire some more people to investigate compliance complaints - I know of at least three businesses that are absolutely flouting the restrictions, that have been reported, but have not been paid a visit by the BOH. Two of these are in a tony suburb of Boston and I know one complaint was made in late spring.

My dog is a rescue who was traumatized after being attacked by another dog.

Then people act like you're the bad dog owner when you ask them to call off their dog. I can't even go to the park by my house anymore because it's filled with bad dog owners who let their dogs run rampant and are too busy socializing with each other to pay attention to them.,1

If your dog is aggressive you shouldn’t be walking it in high traffic areas with lots of dogs and people around. Take a little responsibility and work with a trainer.

The Mass Audubon Society has determined that the Fells is an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the Reservation provides essential habitat to breeding, wintering, and/or migrating birds. Thus, keeping dogs under control and leashed is important for the preservation of significant bird populations or communities. Similarly, allowing dogs to swim in Fells vernal pools and ponds is harmful to the habitats of a wide range of aquatic species. Spot Pond, the High Service and Winchester Reservoirs provide fresh drinking water resources to residents north of Boston. To protect these public supplies No Swimming regulations apply equally to humans as well as dogs.

If a driver pauses for a bike or pedestrian, we may lose that opportunity to safely get onto Main Street and then be either forced to wait forever for another opportunity (pissing off everyone behind us) or dangerously drive into traffic.

"In addition to looking for COVID, they look for RNase P. Invalid means that they couldn't detect RNase P, suggesting that either (a) the swab didn't actually pick up cells, (b) the RNA extraction failed or (c) the sample degraded severely in transit. If you don't detect COVID or RNase P, you repeat the test and/or extraction. If you get the same result, you assume there's no RNA and the test was invalid. 

(If you detect COVID but don't detect RNase P, that's still a positive, since you can pick up the virus without picking up cells, especially in an active infection.)

Inconclusive is different. It means that one of the two COVID markers they look for is above threshold, but not the other one. That's not something that should happen biologically, so there's either a false positive or a false negative. Repeat the test with fresh RNA if possible (to eliminate cross contamination).

"At first the majority of comments we're pretty much calling me stupid and uninformed without offering any actual advice. The comment I responded to was one of the first ones with actual advice. From the beginning I tried to make it clear that I am aware of how difficult our current plan was. That's the entire reason I posted in the first place. Yes, I consider comments that ignore all of my questions and only offer insults as berating. Of course the thread has evolved but that is what I was specifically talking about. 

And offering more financial info, $1500 is only 40% of our overall income.( I rounded down the hourly wage and round down from our expected income to account for taxes) So i simplify it by estimating $4000 a month which is a little higher than we really expect. Where we just came from rent was closer to 60% of our income. The rest of our bills are ~$800 leaving us with ~43 percent of our overall income remaining. Additionally, her mother and husband have offered to pay our utilities. 

When we looked at advertisements for places in the area, it seemed like there were a good amount for $1500 that seemed doable. Since that is the opposite of what we expected and the opposite of what you guys have told us we were excited to see that but also cautious about hoe realistic it was. As you guys have mentioned, they're more than likely not going to be as good as they seen so we're looking further out. 

P.s. a lot of places are hiring and I'm sure we can easily find something better than our current jobs. We just accepted it because an income while job searching is always better than none.",1
"Could maybe have then drop it off at a T station. Plenty of spots nowadays, and you could jump in the train to go get it.",1
"Yeah, I'm still applying to actual jobs, the retail job is not where we plan on stopping. It's literally just to make things work out for now. I have a few companies in the area that I've been interviewing with but I don't want to rely on anything that is not yet guaranteed. That's why were budgeting with our current situation. As I've mentioned, what we saw listed online seemed better than what we've expected and a lot of people have given good advice as I had hoped for.",1
"My hometown is pretty darn red. That makes me sad, but also glad that I don’t live there anymore and didn’t have to drive by the Trump signs all day.",1
"See, we saw some many places listed around $1500 in medford and assumed that it was a lot more realistic than it actually is. We're still looking though. And of course we're being wary of and vetting places as best as we can, making sure to actually come by in person, verify the ownership/connection of whoever we're talking to (in person) and not giving out personal information until were sure it's legit. Its just without knowing all of the major and minor areas intimately as well as the associated price point, I was becoming overwhelmed. Thats why i appreciate the helpful advice people give because it helps us know where to look. Thanks for pointing out this is a scam and saving me time because I wouldn't have realized as quickly as you did.",1

Thanks for the encouragement, it's definitely possible, and I'm proud of you for having made your way up in life. We have both been through worse poverty than where we're at right now and living further out isn't really a problem.",1
"Its sadly not an EE job. I have some interviews that I hope will work out but I'm trying to work with what we have right now rather than what we're working towards but don't yet have. So, were budgeting on 13 , even though we're actively looking for higher pay.",1
"It's not that I think I can, I admitted I don't know anything and asked for help and suggestions. I mentioned what I was hoping for (based on what seemed feasible from  ads I saw online) but it turned out that the ads were misleading.

Without a baseline, even after looking into things, you see how far off my estimates are, thats why I asked for advice.

I currently drive out to Church St. or Concord Rd., park and pick up the trail from there.  It'd be nice to be able to just ride straight from home and get there.",1
I would suggest Lynn. Probably has some of the cheaper rents while still having decent access to the commuter rail.,1
Plus being close to water is always nice. I have a lot of family in Lynn and lived there for some time when I was a kid. Gets a bad wrap but I love it.,1
Yep. That one at least gives you a bit more time to look over your shoulder for traffic. They should still fix it though. I always thought getting onto 24 was much worse because there is almost zero visibility.,1

It would be so easy to throw in a rotary there too. Fun fact, there are zero stoplights on the Vineyard. I’m not entirely sure of the reason but it’s been that way forever. 

They were doing construction on Beach Road between Edgartown and OB a while back, and it was down to a one lane road. The only reasonable course of action was to put temporary stop lights in, but it received a crazy amount of backlash. The locals are interesting folks.",1

"I live in this neighborhood. What OP linked you is a scam, 100%.

In Medford you *might* get lucky with a small 1 bedroom for $1500. It’s rare, but it happens. I had a friend with an apartment for that price, but it was 3-4 years ago. 

If you want to live without other roommates, you’ll need a better paying job than what is basically minimum wage. Prepare for sticker shock.",1

"Hi there, congrats on the new opportunity! Boston is great, but it is also wildly expensive. Have you looked at a few cost of living calculators? I don't say this to discourage you from making the move, but to make sure you're adequately prepared. I'm afraid I can't help on the job front with suggestions beyond having him update his resume, check it *very carefully* for spelling and grammar mistakes (I'm in HR and if there's a bunch of qualified candidates you're more likely to have your resume rejected if it's the poorly written one), and reach out to staffing firms in the Greater Boston area for placement help.

"My username says it all.  I live in Bangkok as a retired expat.
I usually return to Boston yearly for 3 to 4 weeks but Covid-19 has made returning this year impossible as I would not be allowed to re-enter Thailand which has managed to successfully suppress Covid by closing it's borders, amongst other measures.

What currently stands out the most are the huge changes brought about by eliminating the elevated ""South-East Expressway"" and the near disappearance of the middle class and middle class housing.  The rollover of South Boston, Charlestown, Jamaica Plain and Somerville from working class to near million dollar upscale is shocking to me  Even such areas as Roslindale, Hyde Park and W. Roxbury, once the bastion of middle class Boston have become forbiddingly expensive  for any kind of traditional household. 
The impoverishment of low wage service workers who, in the 70s were at least able to sustain basic needs with what they earned is a singular disgrace.  

When I was in grade school, we'd be shown pictures of places like India with homeless people sleeping in the streets, emphasizing to us how lucky we were to live in America where everybody had a home.   How ironic and shameful it is that I see far fewer people sleeping on the sidewalks of Bangkok than I do in Copley Square.

The 70s were as racially divided and confrontational as any in my lifetime.  This was the decade of forced ""Busing"" to integrate schools and the volcanic hatred it engendered was frightening and disheartening.  It put little children in the crosshairs of violence and  was a tragic era of social engineering that Boston has yet to recover from, it's public school system to this day still in tatters. It is beyond my capability to describe how horrible it was.  Instead, please Google ""Theodore Landsmark Photo"" and read the story behind it.  That one photo says it all.",1

While I hate Comcast and the other isp monopolies, and their service is definitely a utility, nationalizing the industry seems dangerous to me, I don’t trust the federal government to have complete and total access/control over communications and internet service. 

The municipal isp seems like the best of both worlds. Internet service is no longer monopolized by a shitty for profit company, but controlled locally by the people that use it via the municipal isp. However, neither is it solely in the hands of a at times incompetent, detached, corrupt, and even dangerous federal government. While I’m sure some local governments might abuse it, the scale of what they can do is far far less than what the abuses the federal government could carry out. Even still, if enough municipalities do this, the feds can still have a hand by providing material support and coordination for the municipalities, without the feds actually owning and controlling it.",1

It's very difficult to meet people in this city unless you went to college here, developed a social network in the school environment, then decided to stick around. 

I personally know several different kinds of people who came here in their 20's as their ""move to a new city"" experiment and ended up leaving within a few years, and the meeting people thing was a big factor in that decision. 

This sub likes to claim just go to meetups etc but the fact is that doesn't work for every type of person, it just doesn't. 

Sometimes it's better to just say ""this isn't working out"" and go somewhere new.",1

I'm not American so Thanksgiving isn't a tradition I'll miss but Christmas is going to be lonely as I can't go home so I was thinking of asking if anyone else in the same position wanted a socially distanced park meetup or something.

Pessimism: all the asymptomatic people with no known exposure traveling for the holidays filled up all the testing spots, meaning people who should have gotten a test (symptomatic, known exposure) couldn't find a slot. I have an extended family member in the latter group (last week, worked with a known positive, needed a test before returning, couldn't find anything for three days). If I needed a test today, I'm not sure where I would go.",1

Finally went to ER and they said my foot was so badly infected that if I delayed much more I would have lost it.

Why are you so wrong about everything,1
"There is some great behavioral science/psychology research on this topic already, in the broader sense.  It is a combination of intermittent reinforcement and a group contingency for reinforcement.  Intermittent reinforcement is when rewards are given randomly (sometimes never) to an individual as long as they have met certain criteria- in this case, taking the vaccine. Group contingencies are when an individual, multiple people or the whole group get a reward based on what an individual, multiple people or the whole group does. In this case, multiple people get the vaccine (maybe not the whole group) and one person gets the reward at random. 

The advantage of intermittent reinforcement is that it “keeps you on your toes” so to speak. You never know if you will get the reward or not and if so when you will.  The advantage of having it be tied to a group of people is the group gives peer pressure for others to do the behavior because it ups the odds of getting the rewards.

Giving rewards based on the number of people getting vaccinated (so like, a million dollars given to one random person for every million people vaccinated) would be the way to scientifically keep the vaccine momentum up.",1

Lol I got targeted. As did one of my coworkers. It's insane.,1
Because herd immunity protects our most vulnerable who literally can’t get the vaccine due to illness or allergies.

I understand that we need better leadership to provide messaging from the kinds of professionals who DO know and who are good at breaking things down in a way that laypeople can understand.

I also think we need to just do a better job in general of familiarizing the general public with how these processes work. How a clinical trial works. Who are the people involved. How does a vaccine (or any medication) get manufactured.

I feel like a lot of the skepticism stems from a sort of general dehumanization of the whole ""system"" as if it's robots out there manufacturing academic papers and drugs from thin air.

Cause I have friends at NIH who work on clinical trials. I used to work at a drug manufacturing factory. Both of my parents and my BIL work in chemical manufacturing.

"No, I guess I should’ve been clearer—undergrads that live on campus are fully remote, while those that are on campus are able to take in person classes and use campus resources. On-campus undergrads have free (required) testing twice a week with Covid pass, but off campus undergrads (me) are charged to get tested. Mostly I understand it because we don’t have access to campus so giving us Covid pass doesn’t make much sense, but also I would like to be able to get tested considering I pay the same tuition. 

To me it also seems fairly likely that off-campus undergrads will be in contact with members of the on-campus population, so I feel like testing would make sense their, but maybe they feel like having off-campus residents come on campus poses a greater risk.",1

"&gt; The biggest single driver of spread these days in Massachusetts is household spread.
&gt; [I can't speak to the specifics of how the virus is spread in Massachusetts, but that statement is not supported by evidence nation-wide.]

There's not a weekly breakout of contact tracing, but comparing the four week average for 10/11-11/7 to the 10/18-11/14 shows an net increase in 5302 contact traced cases, of which 4712 are household spread. The reason likely comes down to how Mass. defines household spread. 

&gt; ""1) A household “cluster” is defined as two or more confirmed Massachusetts cases, who reside at the same address with COVID-19 infection within 28 days of each other, and who are not associated with another cluster

Basically, if two people get sick in the same household and they don't have any idea where they got it, it's household spread. If your kid catches it at the grocery store and spread it around the house, household cluster. If you catch it at work and the executive who coughed in the bathroom before you used it never gets tested, then you give it to someone else in your house, household cluster. 

It's very easy to get household spread and it's very hard to figure out where in the world you initially caught the bug, so household clusters are going to be big numbers. 

&gt; We are launching a public awareness campaign called #getbackmass

&gt; ""It's a reminder that we must continue to fight so we can get back to the things we love to do.""

Oh, I thought the campaign was about distancing. GET BACK, GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DISEASE RIDDLED PEASANTS!

&gt; R: If the number of people taking tests continue to go up after Thanksgiving is over, is there a plan to increase lab capacity?

&gt; C: We anticipate that there will be additional capacity that will come online in mid-December.

Oh, good, just in time for Christmas travel. We really need it now, though. Not just due to the Thanksgiving rush, but we want as much testing as readily available as possible to try and pull some of those household clusters into more informative areas.",1

The only time I've been asked for money is AT the lease signing, we did it in person, not sure how it works in the times of COVID. We brought 3 checks and labelled them for the realtor, 1st month, last month like I said above. They checked our credit and validated our checks on the spot. 


Frankly, I don't know your circumstances, but I'd use a different group than the one that asked you to use venmo. Check is always fine and credit checks should move quick too. Professional companies usually have quicker ways (phone numbers, online systems) to validate checks and credit.

I did a quick scan of your profile to see if I could get a bit more background on you. 120-150k is pretty optimistic for your first job out of college (but who knows what it will be like in 6 years). It's doable, and your GPA/AP classes seem to indicate you're pretty smart, but it's gonna be 5% of new grad roles where you can expect that pay.

I've never looked at real estate in the area you're describing, but I'd bet its expensive. You could probably afford to live there on 120k/year, but youll be living like someone who makes far less than that.

Compared to NYC/Bay area, expect to make 10-15% less by virtue of being here instead for the same role at the same company. 

Lastly, if your goal is to move to boston after college, maybe look at some more schools in this area since they will have partnerships with local businesses. UMASS Amherst has a great reputation, and UMASS lowell has a great reputation for engineering. On the pricier side you can look at northeastern and WPI. If you have it in you, cant hurt to apply to harvard and MIT. If you want somewhere as a middle ground for cost, the colleges of the fenway have some good schools.

The Boston/ Cambridge area feels like the San Francisco of the east. Most of the companies there are medium-big in size (mine is about 1,400). I love looking in buildings on the way to the T and seeing the cool biotech and engineering projects on video display that each company is working on. It is very expensive to live here so that sucks but with a 6 figure income you could definitely live quite well. Although expensive it’s still a bit cheaper than NYC housing. The pay is similar to NYC maybe a little less depending on field although tech it would be on par. It sounds like in terms of lifestyle/ hobbies it could be a fit.

This gap is why the state is rushing ""rapid tests"" to schools. They know there's a big problem they're not uncovering.

"And oxycontin has been given out without a prescription. But that's by people breaking the law, just like Gosnell did, only he killed actual babies and at least one woman. Doctors acting within the law do not perform abortions that are not medically necessary. There isn't a single state that allows late term abortion without medical cause.

But back to my original point. You made the claim that medically necessary abortions are not a point of dispute, nor are early term abortions. But that's not true. There is a vocal minority of anti-choice activists who are trying to make both those things illegal and are doing a ton of work at the state level to pass personhood amendments and abortion bans based on week of gestation or the cause of the pregnancy (consensual sex vs rape/incest.) These same activists have also been pushing laws making it harder for women to obtain abortions at any time, like TRAP laws, 24-hr waiting periods, mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds, defunding of local health care clinics, superfunding of crisis pregnancy centers which provide no medical at all, and so on. And then there are the highly vocal small number of crazies who picket abortion clinics, harass clinic workers and people seeking reproductive care, and who take even more extreme actions like bomb threats -- and actual bombs. And this is to say nothing of the judicial strategies employed by these people -- mostly Christian nationalists -- to seat religious extremists on appellate courts hoping to overturn precedent at the state and federal level.

You have, in your simple statement, disregarded 4 decades of violent anti-choice activism on two issues you claim are uncontroversial.

To your latest point, whether medically unnecessary late-term abortions should be permitted is actually not a highly controversial subject. There has been no major push from pro-choice advocates to legalize abortion up to birth for reasons other than medical necessity, either for the woman or the fetus. What you're calling disagreement is actually right-wing propaganda. Less than 1% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks -- so this is a tiny number of overall patients. When physicians and gynecologists DO encounter the rare woman who seeks an abortion after 24 weeks *without medical necessity -- a much tinier subset --* those are usually situations where there is domestic violence, the woman is depressed, the woman is on drugs, the woman is suddenly raising kids (or is pregnant) on her own, she tried to get abortion care earlier but because of other restrictions/cost she couldn't, or she is extremely young and had no idea she was pregnant. Those situations are largely handled through better social welfare programs and sex education, not hand-wringing about a non-issue.",1

"The joys of federalism. Good question.

So this is like when segregation was illegal at the federal level but legal at the state level. It's also like the issue we're dealing with today regarding marijuana legalization.

There's a difference between a national abortion ban by constitutional amendment, and a national abortion ban by federal statute.

It's extremely hard to get an amendment to the US constitution. The last one was passed in the 1990s. Let's consider that out of scope for now.

More likely, in a 5-4 or possibly 6-3 decision, SCOTUS in the future overturns Roe v. Wade, removing the ""federal floor"" protecting baseline abortion rights and opening the door to restrictive legislation.

Let's further assume that the Republicans control both houses of Congress and the presidency.

Okay, so in this horrifying dystopia, the GOP Senate and House pass a bill criminalizing abortion. The providers could be subject to criminal prosection, women seeking abortions could be subject to criminal prosecution, their partners or anyone who enables their access to abortion (e.g. a boyfriend who gives them money) could be subject to criminal prosection, and companies that manufacture and distribute medical abortifacent drugs could be subject to criminal prosection. The president then signs that bill into law or 10 days pass with no answer to Congress and the bill automatically becomes law.

At that point, any protection for these groups of people in state constitutions is only relevant insofar as the state can't pass laws criminalizing abortion care. And state funding and access to abortion could still be provided.

BUT! Any person in these states with state-level protection could still be subject to federal prosection. If the Justice Department gets needed funding from Congress to engage in these investigations and prosecutions, and they have an interest in doing so, they could totally prosecute women, men, and individuals at corporations for violating federal law. There could also be financial impact to the states. The federal government could withhold money from state governments for providing any sort of abortion care or access. The federal government could come in and shut down clinics like Planned Parenthood by force. 

Basically, life would suck big time for anyone in the country who's sexually active. The more Christian nationalists the right wing successfully gets into positions of power, the more likely these scenarios are to happen.",1

I rode Fung Wah to NYC many times. I was a big fan of it despite a few annoying situations. A tire blew out on the bus one time and we had to wait on the side of the highway.

Another time they only had a small bus (like a part bus) available but sold more tickets than seats so a few of us took turns standing so others could sit during the ride.,1

We sat outside in 90+ degrees weather in some parking lot, waiting around 2 hours for a bus rescue in what was like the hottest day in May. (And this was the day Chris Cornel died, but that's not bus related, more mood related haha). I was super stressed out about missing the concert,  but I arrived just in time as a sweaty, gross mess.

"It's the strawman you created - pretending like SARS-CoV-2 is some super-special ""this and that"" by dismissing that pre-COVID studies are most certainly relevant in understanding how it spreads and what can protect individuals. 

The meta-analysis I posted clearly stated that there is no evidence of strong protection - it is statistically insignificant, hence very small (perhaps non-existent in terms of general public use). These technical points are beyond most people, but I use this kind of analysis in my line of work and I get paid to provide an opinion. Moving on...

So sure masks may do a little bit (especially in indoor, health care settings) - but stop pretending like they are going to make any significant difference in the grand scheme of things in terms of cases or deaths. They do NOT have any significant effect, period. Nothing you think will change that. The WHO can recommend whatever desperate measures along with anyone else, but that still doesn't mean that masks make a significant difference. And stop pretending like ""dat no good person wid no mask on in da street is killin' people"" - that is such a gross exaggeration.

Theyve changed how they set up the line since i went there a month or 2 ago... But in any event... You wait in line.... They confirm you have an appointment.... then they have you scan a QR code, which basically puts you in a Queue to go inside.... They pull 15-25-40 people at a time, which y you will get notified on your phone that you can actually enter the building, where you then socially distance as you go through the building to the 2nd floor where you wait in line still, and essentially its next person in line to the next open window..  They can do all transactions at ANY window... and if memory serves me right, they have like 30 windows open...

"That still isn't likely to make much difference, unless someone is right on the threshold of a rapid test. 

The issue with rapid tests is they're inherently less sensitive than PCR. That means they can easily miss new and/or mild infections. You could, in theory, take a thousand rapid tests on day 1 or 2 or 3 and not pop positive once. The only thing that's going to increase your likelihood of getting a positive on a rapid test is the time it takes for the infection to build.

Rapid tests are meant to be used to confirm suspected infections, not confirm the lack thereof. It's the same story with rapid flu tests. In an ideal world, they wouldn't be used *at all* for people not showing symptoms of a respiratory infection.

 Donald trump honestly may do that next election if he loses the Republican Primary (and is not in jail). You need someone with that level of charisma. We just have not seen one that lost the primary in a long fucking time. Its a weird balance you need just enough charisma to inspire a decent chunk of the electorate to follow you but not so much you win the main parties primary likely due to your ideas being tooo radical for the centrist in a party to fall in line. People think that trumps ideas were radical when he ran the first time. For republicans they weren't his promises were simple, strong immigration and cutting the spending down in Washington.

Where do sick people stay no matter what? At home. Who is most contagious? People who are more symptomatic. All facts. This pre-symptomatic virus-aerosol non-sense floating out of peoples' mouthes at restaurants is pure doomer-fantasy. The CDC has clearly stated that aerosol transmission has only been documented a handful of times and under special circumstances only. So yeah, it's mostly happening in places where people live (prolonged exposure and close proximity).

"&gt;Are you saying that fomite transmission (contaminated objects) is the mechanism of transmission within households, 

No. People in households socialize (e.g. roommates hanging out, drinking, smoking, etc.). Maskless, too, and funny enough just about all if not all of the CDC studies about ""mask effectiveness"" are all about indoor-specific settings (and often with people who are sick, too).  That's direct, close range exposure to short-range droplets, which is the main way this thing spreads other than touching sick people directly. 


&gt;how do you explain the early choir clusters?

This is the ""special circumstance"" I mentioned in my previous reply. Further research in these settings could not rule out other methods of transmission. 

It's doomer fantasy to assume there is a high risk of spreading the virus this way. They have a handful of ""well documented"" instances of it... out of how many total instances? A billion? How many choirs, restaurant dining sessions, etc. have there been since March? Billions is probably about right.

I’m not saying the state made the case he was guilty, he shouldn’t have been convicted based on the evidence. I’m just saying I didn’t walk away - after 8 episodes - convinced he wasn’t involved.

I think the simpler explanation is that our wastewater analysis is just not actually all that wrong.

While I have only eaten outside, I’ve seen plenty of people sitting inside for much longer than your average worship service (and in many cases in closer proximity than your average New England church could pack a pew during the last 30+ years during normal times). 

I’m proposing this as an explanation of part of why the place of worship cluster to case ratio is so high, the other places are so low, and we have such a high number of cases with no known source. I would propose that we don’t know well what we can’t track well.",1

"&gt;diners are likely contributing to higher rates of transmission because they're probably talking to others at the table (known to increase output of respiratory droplets) and are in low-ventilation, air-exchange &lt; 3x hour indoor rooms for longer than 30 min. at a time. 

The alternative is they talk to the same people in their home. No one is avoiding socializing for 1-2 months, let alone 18, which is where this is headed. 

And while they are ""contributing"" to the spread it does not mean they are a large proportion of it.

&gt;Respiratory droplets are the primary cause of transmission. Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

Respiratory droplets are short-range and highly directional (talking loudly, yelling, coughing, sneezing directly at someone). Even if you looked right at your server when you placed your order and started talking (vs. while looking at the menu, as many people do), you're probably not going to hit him in the face with saliva (they're often above you, your saliva has to work against gravity), and even if you did, you'd have to be perfect-timing the worst time to dine out, which is shortly before you become symptomatic (you think you're fine, but you'll become ill soon)... but that's assuming you are even sick, and Fauci said that ~0.8%? (and many of these people are symptomatic, so this are unrealistic worst case odds of someone being ill when they dine out) of the population is infected at any given point in time. Pretty slim odds here of anything bad happening. You're basically worrying about ""that one guy who had his first COVID-sneeze while out in public."" Going too far for too little here. 

Also, touching sick people directly is bundled with respiratory droplets. That's probably even higher risk, especially intimate touching (read: kissing, household activities w/ family where you touch someone's face, etc.) 


&gt;Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

These are one-off instances. There have been literally countless *possible* instances of transmission like this around the world, yet only a few documented instances of transmission. Also, singing and talking loud is night and day. 

&gt;Eating at a restaurant for dine-in is an optional activity. Ideally, people would takeout and tip generously for staff risking their safety. Although, I agree it would be better PPE practice if K/N95s were provided to staff/high risk grocery workers.

K/N95 masks have been readily available in stores. Some Asian markets have KN95 10-packs for ~$20.",1

Your concern is valid as it seems you've followed exactly what the health organizations have both directly told you, and both CDC and WHO recommendations for when to see others, but as many orgs have pointed out, people do test positive well after they're contagious. I so appreciate you following the rules around getting tested before coming here, but more than likely whether you test positive or not, as long as you've been symptom free for two weeks you're among the least likely to be actively spreading covid as you now have antibodies that prevent renfection for a couple months.

I also danced in the Boston Ballet growing up.  My mom drove me up to 4 times a week into Boston and I danced at the Wang Theater in many performances. We even had a dance for the opening of the Zakim Bridge which I vividly remember because our ""cars"" crashed at the end of the dance haha.

Tourists DON'T drive me crazy, I love the smell of the USS Constitution and our museums are great.

Commerce clause specifically regulates interstate commerce. It would be an interesting argument if suspending mortgages qualified but let people argue it out in court and if the SCOTUS strikes it down we know it is illegal but people get a reprieve from rent and mortgages for a couple months.

"About asymptomatic transmission. The reason for the apparent contradiction is slightly differing definitions of “asymptomatic”. Kerkhove was referring to people who test positive but _never_ show symptoms. Fauci was referring to people who currently don’t show symptoms, including those who show symptoms (also called “presymptomatic”) later AND those who do not. Presymptomatic transmission is very real and significant, and why we wear masks. Scientifically speaking, both definitions are legit (if confusing), and when the terms are clear, there is no contradiction.

Most importantly, in public parlance “asymptomatic” has come to mean the latter—ie including presymptomatic folks. Also, as a practical matter, you don’t know if you‘ll have symptoms later. So when speaking to the general population, it is correct (and smart!) to say asymptomatic transmission is real.",1

But that was before they dropped a bunch of probable hospitalizations from the data, so fuck if I know where we are relative to that estimate.

Plus infections are trending younger, so IFR is naturally going to be lower anyway.",1

"Mainly what I am upset about, regarding Baker, is the incessant goalpost shifting. At the beginning of the summer, he and the DESE refused to give guidance to schoold districts about re-opening. They told districts in July to make three plans (fully open, hybrid, and remote obly) and to submit those plans. All districts did this, and then very quickly (within days) had to have SChool Committees choose a path for their district. Different SC made different choices. 

Then the DESE came out with a “map” (what everyone sees now, the color-coded mal by town) for what districts should do. Keep in mind this map was released after districts had made the decision of what to do. Red was fully remote, yellow was hybrid or remote, and green was fully open or hybrid. They said all districts should follow that map and if your school district community went red, shift to remote learning (or vice versa for other colors, etc). About 70% of districts in MA went hybrid or fully remote at this point. 

Then when the numbers started going up, they changed the guidance. Now you had to be red for THREE weeks to go remote. 

Then they changed the guidance again and said that red didn’t mean you should go remote at all. This was about two weeks ago, as numbers were skyrocketing and communities were jumping into the red left and right. 

Now they threw away that map because it looks bad (120 red communities) and made all those communities yellow. And everyone should be in school, deapite the fact that the highest case rates are in the population of school aged children. Now DESE (and very foolish people online) are saying that students are getting the virus because they aren’t in school... except most kids ARE in school AND when they weren’t in school (April through Sept), children numbers were VERY low. 

So to me, its the data manipulation, the lies, the goal post shifting, and the very very bad “science” they are using.",1
"Oh thank you! So hmm if I'm thinking about this correctly we shouldn't compare current number of cases to April because the number in April should have actually been way higher had everyone had access to tests. But if we compare the rate of 30% in April to now which is only 3% positive out of all tests.. we're still much better off than April, right? 🤔🥴",1

But if the initial vet visit sees ANYTHING remotely close to a symptom, insurance won't cover it, forever, as pre-existing.  And unless they pay to cover something, you don't get any value for the premiums.

"Wellness coverage often isn’t really worth it financially. Most wellness visits at the vet are usually around $100-$300 once or twice a year so the math doesn’t really work out. And then keeping up with preventative health saves a lot more money in the long run too... like the cost of brushing your dog’s teeth every day vs dental x-rays and extractions etc. Definitely recommend looking into accident and illness coverage though. Regardless of whether you go through with the insurance, I’d also recommend that you apply for a CareCredit card preemptively.

"The 1584 is the 7 day average of based on when the tests were reported. The ""New Cases Per Day"" graph is a 7 day average based on when the tests were taken. There's going to be a small offset there.

There's also the issue where it'll take a little while for the tests taken to be reported, so you'll typically cut off the last few days in making the charts that rely on ""swab taken"" dates. The last seven actual days are 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604, 1205, 377 and 4. You can see that's pretty useless for a seven day average, since you've got a couple days that are just too soon for tests to be returned. Even that 1205 will probably jump a bit.

So, instead, you cut off the last three or so days and end up with 1133, 871, 518 followed by the same 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604 for the ~1400 average on the graph. Since our trajectory is upward and there were a couple of weird days around Halloween where we dropped below 1k, every day we'll see more cases reported, but we'll have to wait a bit for the ""new cases per day"" graph to catch up. 

Also, expect a big jump in a few days in that line when those two Halloween days drop out and the 1205, 377 and 4 get filled in with reported tests. It's one of those things that will be dramatic looking, but it's the same old scary trend catching up in the graphs rather than a new scary trend.",1

Yes, but why?

Moral righteousness isn't magic. Masking and the fact that the protests occurred outdoors during the summer may have helped, but changes in behavior of non-protestors (staying home) probably also contributed. If there is widespread celebration without good social distancing practices, we will all suffer the consequences.

I don't know about middle and high school students, but I am looking at the elementary school kids (neighbors and friends) - they all go to extra curricular activities. Some even get sent to a ""daycare"" for their remote hybrid days, as both parents have to work. If we assume that there's a  risk of transmission anywhere, wouldn't it be better for kids to just go to school and nowhere else? At least spread would be somewhat localized, versus it getting spread all over the place? 

So by keeping schools hybrid we are effectively trading kids going to the same place every day with the same group of peoe for kids going to different places every day with different people. I understand the teachers position fully, especially ones who are in a risk group, but I honestly don't know whether keeping schools hybrid vs in person would make that huge of a difference from perspective of virus spread in the larger community.",1

Then whenever I called them, they would tell me that I needed a “Level 2” person, but there was never one available.

"Quote:

*""Lockdown measures intended to keep people safe from COVID-19 in the United States may have put some schoolchildren in danger, says Margo Lindauer, director of the Domestic Violence Institute at Northeastern. But one wouldn’t know it from the decline in reported cases of child abuse and neglect.  In reality, there’s a higher likelihood that child abuse and neglect have persisted or increased during the pandemic, Lindauer says. But without access to the customary channels of communication—such as schools and doctor’s offices—these cases have largely gone unreported.""*

*“What the data shows is that many child abuse and neglect reports come in through school; teachers, paraprofessionals, and nurses are mandated reporters,” says Lindauer, who is an associate clinical professor of law at Northeastern. “In a non-pandemic world, [if] kids come in with a bruise, or they haven’t been fed or bathed, or they have consistent injuries or pain, that potentially could be reported to a child welfare agency.”*",1
"As of right now- yes, look- it is a horrible situation all around.  I have no answers or solutions- my frustrations are at the situation- however, the cases that are spreading in schools right now- are affecting families of any child that attends school and following them home.  There are over 250 cases of Covid in schools- and it’s a low number relatively because so many have remained remote.  Forcing kids back into schools might seem like a good idea to help right now- but it is only going to explode Covid cases statewide more than they were back in April and May.  I’m legit scared. For myself, for families with at risk members, and for my students.  While Covid might not kill children, it kills many who care for those children.",1

There is so much time devoted to staying safe- that any time on learning is FAR less than what they would receive virtually on a screen- where they can clearly see the teachers’ face, and their friends faces.  So do not tell me to get a grip.  I’m barely holding on to my grip and this year has only just begun.

"&gt; this is 3 days worth of October data that just happened to get released today so

The data that is added in today from that October delay is actually relatively modest. As I mentioned above, we can subtract yesterday's daily totals from today's daily totals to see where new cases were posted. It's at most 181 cases (the total number of October cases added), but it's probably less than 100. There's 73 that look like outliers because they're about a week old and should've been reported before this. After that, there's 89 on Halloween that look like the normal reporting delay and the other 1857 were all reported starting November 1st, which would be outside the scope of the footnote. The wording of the footnote is a little tricky: 

&gt; Today’s 2,038 new cases include 3 days of delayed data from tests performed in October by a national laboratory. Today, this lab reported almost 300 cases, and on average reports fewer than 50.

They're reporting 3 days of delayed tests from October and they're reporting almost 300 cases rather than the normal 50, but it doesn't say that the excess cases are actually from October. Since we have the new and old raw data, we can see that they weren't.

&gt; Not actually over 2000 daily cases. Still around 1200

You mention below that you're referring to page 6, but that number is still being backfilled. The tests taken this week haven't been fully reported back. It's pretty common for it to take a few days for the data to stabilize, which is why most of the charts that cover percentages either crop out the last couple of days or refer to the ""Due to lag in reporting by laboratories, counts for most recent dates are likely to be incomplete"" footnote. 

Today's report added 362 cases on Monday (to bring it to 1684), 295 on Tuesday (1330), 816 on Wednesday (1187) and 282 on Thursday (282). We won't know how high they will actually end up for a little while. If we assume the same basic delay and backfill rate, you could be looking at a week of 1600-1700ish numbers. It'd be nice if it did stay lower, but there's no evidence to support that.

It's definitely true that the numbers shown here and at the top of the thread tend to be shifted around a little. Monday/Tuesday tends to be a little lighter and Thursday/Friday tends to be a little big heavier because of when tests are taken and when they're reported, but that's (a) a reason to mostly focus on the 7 day averages and (b) still a valid way of discussing tests as long as you're consistent about what number you're looking at. 

Reported date is convenient because, as I showed above, it's a lot easier to see what the number is today rather than trying to figure out exactly what happened to test totals across an entire worksheet. Tests aren't being double counted, so if we have one outlier day, it'll be pretty obvious pretty quickly and it'll smooth itself out (like it did when they upgraded the dashboard on the 24th and dumped two days of results on us). We're also all sort-of used to the normal weekly variation, so it's not something that drives conversation too much.",1
"Jesus, those are all stupid measures and would drive me batty also, to be honest.  COVID-19 is virtually harmless to kids, far less dangerous than the flu. This is dumb.

"I am not familiar with any well-grounded form of public policy, health or otherwise, that considers pragmatism to be anything other than achieving the greatest tangible effect at the smallest degree of intervention.

We have very high mask adherence in MA. We will never reach 100% nor reach 0% human error. We don't disagree about that. We also seem to agree that the vast majority of transitory outdoor situations, mask or no mask, are of virtually zero epidemiological relevance.

This precondition sets the stage for the newly expanded mask mandate to be - *at best* - a vanishing degree of marginal benefit in pursuit of Nth-degree micro-management.

Your justification that it will lead to a little improvement at the margins bakes in several assumptions: that the relatively obscure hypothetical you're plucking from one end of the behavioral distribution long tail occurs at any type of frequency that impacts transmission; that the behavioral outliers on the other side that you're failing to at all consider won't become stronger negative contributors to pandemic control (e.g. the person who normally complies with indoor mask usage now goes ""fuck all of it""); that the expansion of this mandate bears no pandemic-related deadweight cost unrelated to the mask vs. no mask question (e.g. population burnout/tiredness at being micromanaged diminishes adherence to other guidance; newfound ubiquity of masks leads to cavalier attitudes about other, more important practices like sustained distancing); and that the expansion of this mandate bears no broader deadweight cost (e.g. bad enforcement actors abuse this newfound power; health-incentivizing behavior like outdoor exercise becomes disincentivized).

None of the things I listed are about ""it won't achieve perfection so it's bad"". All of them are about ""we need to think broadly about marginal returns and unintended consequences to be sure we're acting sensibly"".

this is the ballot question in Florida. MA voted on similar lines for a minimum wage increase, only we will reach ours faster because we voted on it in 2018. 

&gt; Last election they voted to give felons voting rights (again something 90% of the privileged Boston eggheads would cringe at)

according to the timeline of voting rights in MA written by the [Emancipation Initiative](https://emancipationinitiative.org/ballots-over-bars/returning-the-right-to-vote/), previously incarcerated individuals in Massachusetts have never been denied the right to vote. for about 30 years, people currently serving time had the right to vote by absentee ballot; this change was passed in 2001.

two flaws here: the NYT has white college graduates at 49 - 49, and acknowledge that they do not account nearly enough for mail in ballots, who were more likely to be that demographic. white college graduates voting for Biden especially increased *in* key swing states, primarily MI, MN, and PA. moreover ""all of Boston"" clearly doesn't line up with your statement, given that Boston, Cambridge, and MA more widely all heavily vote Democrat. if the demographic of specifically Boston voters, and more broadly college educated white voters, was overwhelmingly Trump, why would the state with the highest proportion of those voters vote overwhelmingly Dem?

Was stupid as fuck",1
It would also mean shutting the borders down and strict enforcement till the pandemic is over.  never going to happen in this country,1
Ya exactly. I don’t believe in masks. I wear them still because I’m not a complete asshole and I’m not trying to cause a scene at the store. Perfect analogy.,1

True you won't be arrested, but you can be removed from the MBTA.

The MBTA is not a public street. If you don't comply with MBTA rules, they can remove you and use force if necessary. Right now, MBTA rules require masks.

It can be a pretty simple interaction. If you're not wearing a mask the cop gives you a choice: (1) put on a mask and accept the fine, or (2) gtfo the train or bus. If you choice neither, he or she can force option 2 on you physically.",1

I think the news to open this one came out about a year ago,1
"I'm actually in an extremely similar boat. From here, lived elsewhere for a long time but always came back a couple times a year until moving back in 2014 and have been here since. 

Yea there's a lot of amazing things that make MA, in my opinion, one of the best places in the country to live, but it's silly to ignore the genuine problems we have.

Like our cost of living and insane lack of affordable housing is not just a problem for people who aren't loaded, it's bad for all of us as a local economy and society.

It means people have less money to put towards small businesses in the area. It makes it tougher for local restaurants to stick around, it makes it more difficult for communities to develop culture, etc. It means people end up wasting more money moving too frequently instead of being able to stay in one place.

These aren't small problems in any way, in aggregate they are hugely impactful to the Greater Boston area and New England as a whole. 

Everyone you know here has probably moved at least twice as much as people otherwise in the same financial situation in the southeast. There's a lot of downstream effects from that. It effects our regions commutes in a huge way for example.",1

"That's a lot of questions, and I'd highly recommend checking out some of the sidebar info, old threads where people ask about living here, and googling.

That being said, from my perspective as a mid-20s professional, I think Boston checks most of your boxes. I have time, so here's some info:

* There is a lot to do. I hike quite a bit, am on a local sports team, and during non-covid times visit museums a lot and have a yearly subscription to Boston in Broadway shows. There's a solid music scene, lots of breweries, good food, and good shopping.
* The economy is solid. I work in software, and my mid 20s friends have all settled in well to the city in white-collar jobs. I have less knowledge on the blue-collar side of the economy, but the Boston area has always had a large population of blue collar workers.
* Boston is pretty expensive. If you want a bit of land and some more space, you'll likely not be able to rent in the downtown area. There are a lot of nice areas within 30 minutes of the city though if you're willing to be a bit further out. I'd explore zillow to get the best idea of what you can get with your money.
* Yeah, the age is pretty mixed. Lots of college kids, tons of mid-20s professionals, and a good number of older people still living in the city. There is quite a bit of diversity, but Boston is a more historically segregated city, so you'll find neighborhoods that are mostly white or mostly hispanic/portugese etc. rather than the whole city being a huge mixing pot of people. There are a lot of churches because this is an old city, but the population itself isn't particularly religious.
* The city is pretty dog friendly. You see lots of people in downtown with dogs, and there wouldn't be an issue bringing a service dog into stores or restaurants. If the service dog is certified, you shoudn't have issues with housing. A good friend of mine has a 24/7 service dog who is always downtown with them.
* Boston is a somewhat smaller and historical city, so the atmosphere is quite different than Chicago or LA. There's a distinct financial district, historic Italian neighborhood (North End) and many distinct parts of the city. It's nice to have a car for day trips out of the city and convenience, but it's a very walking-friendly city. My SO has a car, but in my 7 years here I never personally have.
* The winter is kind of grey and sucks a little, but imho it's worth it for the rest of the year here. And there's easy access to skiing/snowboarding if you're interested.",1
"I didn't say zero, I said minimal. With all of the actual harm going on in the world, ""I habe to wear a mask on my walks"" is the most frivolous, privileged hill to die on.",1
"That's so frustrating. I bike to work every day and can't believe the number of runners and other bikers who don't have a mask on, let alone around their chins doing nothing. Like at least give me the illusion that you have enough self respect to have a mask on your person. I have asthma, wear glasses, and have no chance to work from home so I have zero patience for complaints from runners/ cyclists about wearing masks.",1
"I think 20 cops is plenty. The goal is not to catch all non-maskers, but to make it known generally that enforcement is occurring. That will be enough to significantly increase compliance.

Most people only need to witness someone getting fined / kicked off once for it to make a lasting impression, at least for a month. So we only need there to be enough for most people to witness someone getting fined or kicked off once every month or so.

I think you put the cops in pairs, so people are less likely to get aggressive with them. Put one pair per subway line - that's 10 cops if you count silver line, and then divide the bus routes into 5 approximal even zones. Have the cops constantly riding, changing trains or buses at every stop, 7 days a week. At that rate, you're fairly likely to bump into a cop at least once a month.",1

"no, I'm pointing out that I think all Democratic leaning states (whether they have the outward image of being very left, like CA, or ""fake liberal,"" like MA, among progressive voters) are *much* less overall progressive than we originally thought. 

each state has some things that are more liberal than others. that's not ""ignoring our own flaws,"" it's being realistic about what a ""real vs. fake"" progressive state looks like. MA has much stricter gun laws when compared to Vermont, which still maintains constitutional carry (you don't need a permit to carry a gun, open or concealed). California had much more difficulty legalizing gay marriage than VT or MA, but now has much stronger protections regarding civil and human for transgender individuals than either state, including being the first and only state to ban trans and gay ""panic defenses."" 

MA in some instances looks more progressive than it actually is (weed laws). in some instances, CA looks more progressive than it actually is (ballot questions, as mentioned above). in some cases, VT looks more progressive than it actually is (gun laws). liberal and progressive platforms are nuanced and cover a lot of different aspects and areas of law, and I think we should be more careful in our assessment of the political leanings of states we perceive as more liberal than ours because of it. 

moreover, I never stated that Massachusetts had no flaws, only that the ballot questions were relevant in addressing flaws in MA. you haven't listed any specific policy from Vermont or California that you would like to see enacted here aside from the accessibility of legal weed, and I agree that it should be more easily available. what else would you like to see? is it possible that in some ways, California is a more liberal state, and in others, Massachusetts is?",1

It's also important to note that pandemics don't stop at state borders. We can do all we want, but as long as the country does badly, we will still be very much affected.

"Liberty is not choosing to spread illness to others. That’s something completely different. Just like Liberty isn’t being able to rape or murder or kill. Liberty is the preservation of freedom for the individual. You wanna be free though, you gotta make sacrifices. 

I don’t get it. These anti-mask motherfuckers will tout how much they support *their* country by going and fighting in a foreign war, but when the war is on their soil suddenly a modicum of fighting is taking away their liberty. They will put on a military uniform because the government tells them to, but a mask is taking away their liberty. They’ll brand themselves with Hawaiian shirts, and militia gear, they’ll organize into cells, all in the name of liberty. 

But they won’t put a tiny piece of cloth over their face. 

A mask isn’t a Nazi uniform. It isn’t a muzzle. It doesn’t identify you as weak or as a supporter of big government. A mask keeps the government from fucking with you. It’s the fucking m16 of the war on this virus. 

So fuck the argument that masks remove liberty. Not wearing a mask isn’t liberty. It’s a selfish tantrum by a small-minded individual who chooses to ignore science, because they don’t actually like to do things for the greater good unless there is some sort of prestige or reward attached.

I'm also a huge critic of his book and supporter of not reading it so trying to find some way to lump us together makes no sense. You're aiming for something that isn't there.

Higher ed. isn't left-thinking. It's (neo)liberal. Don't conflate the two. Higher education wants everything at the same time and has no means of getting it. The people who work in the field, especially at the collegiate level, are absolutely obnoxious and stand for nothing. They're so used to playing victim that they don't know how to take a stance in materialism (e.g. get results, keep them, and say that maybe this is our reality). You don't need to explain that to me and if you need a third person to tell someone else so that's basically why I have this account.

Kendi's claim about racism is like what, 1/12 of what we need to have this discussion? The real issue is about how income correlates with success anyway.

"I wanted to have my dates correct when I composed that post so naturally I went to Wiki and was surprised how little information was there...mostly just cross-references to successor agencies.  
My personal knowledge relies on a ageing brain, an often unreliable and anecdotal date-base.  I grew up in the Reading, Melrose, Malden area so the MDC was always in the background of our lives then, controlling the many parkways and wooded reservations in that vicinity.
It's difficult to understate the all encompassing influence the MDC had on the eastern half of the state, post WW2.
They controlled the entirety of the water supply network and all public lands.   Most of the major roadways leading into Boston were controlled by the MDC as well.  Because it's leadership positions were all appointed with no term limit, it was not in any way accountable to the electorate.  
It's important to understand that in the era up to the 80s, the Massachusetts Governor was  very weak.  He was answerable to the ""Governor's Council"" a holdover from Colonial days and the President of the Senate actually had more practical power. It was notable that during the 80s and 90s, that senate president was non-other than William ""Billy"" Bulger, younger brother of the infamous gangster and serial murderer James ""Whitey"" Bulger. He went on to become president of U-Mass/Boston.

I would suggest you start your research into the MDC by focusing on the planning and development of the Quabbin Reservoir which was probably the MDCs signature project.  From that research, a lot of ancillary information should become apparent.

"Both. You'll have a mix of 2 apartments per floor, floor through apartments/condos, and some (pricey) single families. Even the condos are pretty expensive to buy. The apartments are about the median to the upper end for the city, and tend to be small given most of these buildings were built in the late 1800s and very early 1900s. My building was built in the 1890s, for instance.",1
"It's fair to note that during the 50s and 60s, the daily newspapers ran stories almost every day: summertime about kids drowning in ponds and abandoned quarries and winter time, kids falling through ice while skating.  There was huge public pressure to do something about it so the MDC and many localities started building a lot of municipal pools and skating rinks as a safer venue and then closed of the unguarded ponds and wetlands.   It seemed like a good idea at the time.",1

The fact that cities are not allowing people to have a picnic with friends in a park, but allowing the same group to sit inside a restaurant and eat a meal tells you about all you need to know about what politicians' priorities are. Keep the rich restaurant owners happy, fuck the restaurant workers and public health.

Any idea like ""DST needs to end"" is by people who forget that we're in DST during the summer. We're out of it otherwise. It starts in March, ends in November.

This means that we'd have less sunlight in the summer and a ton of sun in the morning anyway.",1

If this was the case everywhere, we would probably be in a much better place with protecting our students/families and enabling in person learning. 

Tragically, it stands to reason that the cost of implementing this at all schools is far outweighed by the costs of not, yet we still find ourselves in this terrible place. Further compounded by the fact that the current federal leadership does not have the desire or intellectual capacity to fund and implement widespread rapid testing that would help us move forward.",1

Then you get to high schools etc, who aren't (because they can't) implementing regular large-scale testing and hoping for the best.

the problem is less the in person learning and more the students who are doing the learning. They are young and reckless even those at MIT and Harvard. Classes give people opportunities to meet up chat and make plans. Not that those things cant happen online but class provides a nice jumping off point for a party. Also if no one had in person classes the number of people that would stick around in Boston would be a lot less.,1

"I agree with you here, and I also think there is some moral conflation happening in this thread more broadly. There are two separate issues that are being seen as one --teenage drinking and teenage drinking during COVID. Should anyone be hanging out in big groups drinking beer right now during a global pandemic? I hope we can all agree that for public health, the answer to that question is no. And holy hell, do I miss drinking with friends.

That said, America has a higher legal drinking age, by several years, than other similarly-developed countries. I am not sure if I'm shocked about the sentiment around teenage drinking tending to be a little more conservative (some might use the term ""puritanical,"" however incorrectly), but I also recognize that this condemnation seems to be an American thing. Teens drinking? Let me clutch my pearls. This might not be as big of a deal in a place like Europe.

(Again, I agree that nobody should be should be hanging out in a group drinking beer in someone's basement during a pandemic. Separate issue.)

I also don't have teenagers, don't ever want to, and therefore have no stake in the claim of whether I would want ""my kids"" drinking at someone's house. I don't want kids, period. But maybe, just maybe, if we didn't make such a huge deal about alcohol, the mystique would be a little less influential on teens looking to have a good time. But then again, I don't know.",1

* Watched live-streamed concerts of my favorite artists (even better when it's FB/IG live since it has a more interactive feel)
* Hopped on the baking band-wagon (it's time-consuming and delicious)
* Re-connected with friends who don't live in Boston (we set up a recurring day/time to hang-out which has helped us stay in touch more easily than one-off chats)
* Went back to the gym a few times for socially-distanced workout classes
* Ordered take-out from restaurants I haven't tried before (Boston isn't as much as a ""foodie"" city as some other places I've been but there are some good restaurants if you really look!)

And some things I want to try:

"A lot of the over-regulation can be traced back to the conflicting array of land management bureaucracies that existed in Massachusetts in the 20th Century; specifically the MDC (Metropolitan District Commission) which was established in the 1890's to oversee Massachusetts state parklands and public resources.  Without going into a lot of historic detail, suffice to say it became a huge bureaucracy and patronage dump that far outstripped it's original mandate.  It even maintained it's own armed police force that competed with the Mass. State Police on many levels.  For many years they were politically untouchable and did and regulated however they wanted with no electoral accountability.   It was finally broken-up in the mid-80s. The Massachusetts Water Resources Auth. (MWRA) and Dept. of Conservation &amp; Recreation (DCR) were established to take over resource management.  The MDC police were absorbed (kicking &amp; screaming) into the State Police.  Most retired immediately as less than 20% of them were able to pass the State Police physical.",1

"I can. I don't believe in public exam schools. They're a disgusting model that saps the city of its resources by making it seem like they're doing right by students. They aren't. Scrap exam schools all together and return schools to their communities for starters. The idea of ""competitive schools"" doesn't make sense. Education isn't a net zero gain.

&gt;Keeping in mind that these schools graduate students who frequently go on to academically demanding colleges.

Right now there's no free college, especially these ones even if they offer financial aid. There's no reason we should feel obligated to send students to college. The only reason that's happened is because other options have been taken away and sent abroad.

We also don't then see the benefits of their education while they drown in debt. The best researchers end up working for private companies. I don't know a single Ph. D working for the government. That's a far cry from decades and decades ago where the government was at the helm of research and basically still is with funding (like how pharmaceutical companies do only a tiny bit of research at the end for their drugs).

The very idea that we're feeding kids into the college system is what makes college even worse. If colleges want the integrity then they should be educating students well enough on their own. It's not our prerogative to make sure kids are ready for an ultimately privatized system.

&gt;It's ""wont to do.""

It's autocorrect. Don't grasp too hard.

&gt;What if the opinion is that this person hasn't shown either the preparation or aptitude necessary to handle Calculus II? Is that racist?

Nope! Someone's either ready or not. But we can also look at scores in the aggregate and see who's ready or not and it does reveal fault lines along demographic lines.

And again, I would say side note: don't even bother with Calculus in high school anyway. People only ever use Algebra and Geometry in their life and never use calculus. Nationalize colleges and teach it there, or in a sort of gymnasium-style system like in Germany.

Honestly, I want to take care of this now because there are some really bad numbers out there, especially in places where you see fewer college students pulling it down. Lawrence had 380 cases last week on 5283 tests.  

It's great that Amherst, Cambridge and Wellesley had sub-0.2% positive rates while having more than one test per five official residents, but Lawrence had a 7.2% positive rate and one test for every ~17 people, so hopefully this week's report will result in flooding it (and all the higher percent areas) with tests.

"Unless you mean multi member districts there isn’t a redistricting  solution.

As it goes now outside of Boston you get a combination of regions not big enough for a full congressional district and the bigger one wins. Like the 2nd district is Greater Worcester, the eastern Pioneer Valley and parts of Suburban Boston. Greater Worcester is the largest individual faction so that’s where the Rep is from. In MA-01 Springfield is larger than the Berkshires/Pioneer Valley so their guy wins. 

In MA-06 it’s the urban North Shore beats out the Merrimack Valley/Suburban North Shore areas. So Moulton/Tierney are from the southern tip of the district. 

MA-03 Lowell beats out metrowest and Lawrence. Each of the top 3 finishers represented a region of the district. 

MA-04 went the way it went because of the South Coast beat the metrowest areas. 

There are just obvious areas of the state that FPTP obviously benifits.

And considering which parts of the state tend to get somewhat disenfranchised (geographically dispersed suburbs) and which disproportionately benifit (Working class gateway cities) I could see the outcomes looking pretty much like Markey/Kennedy

People who oppose you aren’t just dumb. They want the system that helps them. Duh. And for Lowell or Springfield keeping the current system preserves their political clout.

"&gt; Unless you mean multi member districts there isn’t a redistricting solution.

There are a variety of ways to fix it, multi-member districts works. I was thinking more along the lines of defining entirely new districts around [communities of interest](https://ballotpedia.org/Community_of_interest), but there are many solutions where redistricting _does_ in fact help people get better representation. I am sure we both agree that what we are trying to maximize here is how representative the elected officials are of the electorate.

Almost every example you gave is further proof that the elected officials aren't really representative of the communities they are supposedly serving, which is just not the point of democracy. I want to vote for someone that will represent my interests and understands my community. Choosing RCV will allow me to do that in a way that doesn't have me casting a vote for a Dem in every single election where I would be better represented by someone else.

&gt; People who oppose you aren’t just dumb. They want the system that helps them.

And short sighted thinking has, since the beginning of time, never helped anyone in the long run. Saying ""yes"" to RCV will enable more third parties (or new ideas) to get their way into the race (either by thought share, or by actually beating candidates that aren't very competitive). In the long run, this will produce more representative congressman in both local and state-level offices. This should be the ultimate goal of the system, not a minority that due to gerrymandering has caused people to stay in office far longer than they should have.",1

"At least in my case, it's not about snow. It's that, as a driving enthusiast I want the highest performance tires on my car I can get. The trade off for having these sticky, maximum traction summer tires, is that they can't be used in cold temperatures, they will actually be damaged, as well as performing poorly. So, I have a second set of wheels I keep my winter high performance tires mounted on. This makes it a matter of about a half hour to unmount my summer tires and mount my winter ones. 

My winter tires are not snow tires, they're high performance tires optimised for great traction on cold pavement. They do perform better in snow than an all season tire, but that's not why I use them. I use them to give me good traction and handling on cold winter roads. ( also, my winter tires are 18"" to deal with pot holes better, something my low profile 20"" summer wheels would do poorly at ).

Given that every mile I drive on my winter tires is a mile I don't drive on my ( expensive ) summer tires, the cost difference of having summer &amp; winter tires vs using all season isn't that great... Mostly the cost of having an extra set of rims.

Some people DO use winter tires to maximise grip in snow, and there is a huge difference between good snow tires like Nokian or Blizzak vs all season tires, but in my case it's more about performance driving... If I lived in Buffalo, I'd run snow tires during the winter, but here in the Boston area we don't get that much snow, so I'd rather optimise for traction and handling on cold dry pavement. 

If you have to ask, you already know that you're okay with all season tires! :-)",1

Furthermore, fun fact. There used to be three swim areas at the turn of the century and an ice house. One was called Eel beach, because it was infested with lampreys. Another was called Death beach because it was next to the ice house and folks would jump in not realizing there was a dredge zone for the ice chute and drown.

Since Greater Lowell is the largest single constituency of the 3rd district (former 5th) they get a representative despite not being the majority of the district.

RCV is not good for them because it means that a cohesive like Greater Lowell benifits from FPTP in primaries.

"&gt; The weekly data doesn't show a huge spike in any of these communities, they mostly seem to be in places North of the city like Waltham and Lawrence.

We're a couple days from town specific weekly data, but JHU's data is broken out by county daily. (It's included in the PDFs, but only started in the raw data archive in August, so I stayed with JHU's figures.)

These are the [most relevant counties, 7 day rolling average, cases per 100k](https://i.imgur.com/B0FZWA4.png). Essex is definitely high, but we know a lot of that is [Lawrence](https://www.cityoflawrence.com/796/Lawrence-COVID-19-Case-Count) since we're looking at 60-100 daily cases from there right now and ~120 total from Essex. The other two that stick out to me are Suffolk County and Bristol County both surging. The southern feed doesn't reach Bristol, though it catches Stoughton (which borders Bristol County). We'll have to see where in Suffolk the spike is coming from, but the spike in Bristol (with a lesser spike in Middlesex and an Essex spike that's due to a more distant Lawrence) makes me wonder if it is concentrated further south. 

That adds another thing to look at in the weekly, though. I've been playing around with choropleths of Massachusetts. If there's a surge down there and there aren't any STS sites, I'm curious if we'll see test %positive spike past 3-5%. If it has, hopefully we'll hear about new testing measures in the press conference before I even get a chance to make the figures.",1

Candidates who already have strong community behind them have a leg up in terms of volunteers, in terms of local name recognition.

Keep in mind that RCV doesn't have a significant impact on general election , R vs D races. It is most impactful in party primaries, where there are often many candidates.

Primary elections have consistently low turnout, especially in midterms. High turnout among a community like Puerto Ricans in MA01 can still propel a candidate to a primary victory.",1

So, for your example, yes, this is a potential con, but this is equally possible in the system we have now. The point is that it is less likely, not impossible, for such events to happen. If these events do happen significantly and frequently enough, then the electorate can choose another voting system that better aligns with how we believe the votes should be cast.",1

"A better idea would the the 18 year term limits for justices on a rotating ""retirement"" schedule.  Gives every president an appointment or two.  When a justice retires from SCOTUS, they get moved back down to the lower courts to finish their lifetime appointments as Senior Justices.

From there, they have a few options:

1. They can work as a true senior justice - basically backfill as a part timer.  They take cases where someone recuses, retires, gets appointed elsewhere, etc. until they decide to fully retire.
2. They resume work as a full time justice.  If there aren't any seats open on the court, you automatically open one for them.  When they full retire from the court, that seat is then open for appointment as normal.  This keeps what are supposed to be our top legal scholars in the system as long as possible, then expands the court in a non-partisan way which has been begged for by the judicial branch for at least a decade now.

In either option above, the ""retired"" SCOTUS justice can also return to SCOTUS to fill in when there is a recusal or other imposition that prevents a sitting justice from hearing a case (illness, retirement, death, or other circumstance that leaves a vacancy).  9 justices at all times, no panic buttons need to be pressed on filling that seat.  If it's a long term vacancy, you just leave that justice in the seat until the next appointment comes up in a few years tops.

The partisan games are removed, legitimately bad justices are no longer going to rule for 50+ years, we get tertiary benefits to the lower courts.",1

"I was describing worst-case scenarios there. Antipsychotic medications don’t always produce severe side effects in all people; everyone’s response is unique. The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find a medication (or, more often, a combination of medications) that has the best ratio of benefit to cost. For some people with psychotic disorders, there’s a medication combo that significantly reduces symptoms without producing severe side effects. Others aren’t so lucky, and living with severe side effects is the cost of living a life that’s free from debilitating psychotic episodes. 

There’s a very common pattern of people starting and stopping their meds, which leads to relapse. I’m sure you can imagine why someone who has had no psychotic symptoms for a year but who lives with bothersome side effects might believe that they can give it a go off the meds. Sometimes that works for a period of time, but usually the symptoms come back. This, to some people, might look like “not wanting help,” but viewing the situation through a more compassionate lens helps us understand why someone might make such a decision.

As far as seeing everyone as an enemy, yes, that really makes it difficult to get help. That’s why our streets are filled with people who have untreated psychotic disorders. Ideally, we can intervene early and help a person get stabilized on meds before their first psychotic break gets too severe. In that case, therapy and family support can help them build insight into the nature of their illness, so that if/when they do experience psychotic symptoms again, they reach out for help before the paranoia becomes crippling. There are plenty of people like that who live satisfying lives. Hell, some of them are even physicians. But there are more who lead very, very difficult lives, and we need to do more as a society to help them.",1

- support polls should not be painted; it’s not hygienic and is prone to chipping. 
- the exterior drains over the color making them appear dirty quickly.  
- the doors should shut faster. 
- plastic seats are better than cloth nastiness but they should be more comfortable and retraction should work better. 
- stops and starts are jerky and the vibration and noise is more intense than the old trains. It’s probably a lighter an more powerful train but they could have designed to match the old performance. 

The concerns are more atheistic but elude to an inferior product. 

For a backdoor to come to light we probably would already be on rocky terms with the Chinese. 

My concerns are:

1. A backdoor causing a denial of service and hindering evacuation or alt something less extreme. This is a worry regardless of origin but tensions with China and gov involvement make it relevant. 

2. I assume they were the low bidder by a decent margin. I’ve looked at high end windows - Chinese were 15k, polish were 30k, and American were 45k.  I also understand their are specs/requirements. While Chinese products can be great, it seems like more often corners are cut. A great train is more than just weight and power. It’s ride noise, ride vibrations, ambiance, drainage. It’s intelligent design coupled with quality metals, plastics, glues, breaks, suspension, motors, motor controllers, electronics, software, glass, paint, etc. Anticipating and preventing issues is a huge and expensive process. The mbta might have specs but if they’re not asking the right questions, it doesn’t matter.

"Other health experts would say this:

Here’s the actual story:

Before COVID-19, according to the evidence, people with symptoms and people who work closely with them (e.g. doctors, nurses) should wear masks. If you aren’t in those categories, wearing a mask is useless-to-slightly-bad. Interestingly this is more or less what many Asian countries have been doing since SARS-1.

If you recall, in the early days of COVID-19, that’s what the WHO, CDC, Fauci, etc told us to do, based on the reasonable assumption that COVID-19 would be similar to other respiratory viruses. Some countries, however, told everyone to wear masks.

Then scientists started observing that countries with strong masking cultures/mandates were doing much better than countries without. It was very striking. At the same time, evidence was emerging that COVID-19 transmission happens a lot _before_ symptoms. This is around when the mask messaging rightly became very much pro-mask, regardless of symptoms.

COVID-19’s high presymptomatic transmission is actually somewhat unusual for respiratory viruses, which explains why masking works more for COVID, but it’s also not some crazy weird hard-to-believe mask-specific mutation.",1

"&gt; My ideal would be ""individuals tested today"" (or, ""individuals' results reported today).

That's already almost entirely what the total tests represents.

The ""repeats"" are rarely repeats in a day, it's anyone who's ever been tested more than once. People getting multiple tests within a single day are a rounding error.

That's why we need a time component to reset ""new individual"" status, and/or why it'd be nice to have the non-higher-ed data broken out daily instead of weekly.",1

If the former, that’s despicable, if the latter, that’s perhaps slightly less despicable, but still awful nonetheless.

Yikes.,1
"I think it has a lot to do with:

1. Masks. There is less virus being transmitted. If I have it, less virus gets through the mask. If you have a mask on, even less makes it through. So you start the infection with a decreased viral load. 

2. Treatments have improved, doctors, nurses, etc. have better learned how to treat the virus 

3. Younger people don’t care and are mostly the ones getting sick 

4. It’s killed off a lot of the most vulnerable already

But death rates are absolutely down. At the peak of the summer spike there were 70k new cases a day, deaths only peaked at 1450 nation wide. This is opposed to the 40k peak of new cases and 3000 peak of new deaths during the spring surge. Almost twice as many new cases resulted in half as many deaths. That is absolutely significant.",1

"No it’s not practical at all, I know plenty of people who are flaunting COVID precautions because they are sick of it and want to go back to life the way it was before. If we tried to institute a winter lockdown nobody would follow it and it would cause a lot of other problems, cabin fever being the least of them.

What the 2 month “lockdown” did was get us off of that drastic curve that we were at back in spring. What’s scary is that it’s not unreasonable to look at the charts from today and see how easily we can be right back to where we were at the height of the curve in a month.

Fortunately deaths are still low and hospitalizations aren’t close to the overwhelming amount they were back in April and May but my understanding is that those numbers don’t tend to increase until a week or two after a positive test so this week will be key in looking at those stats.

Like I said, there’s no real answer and no matter what decision gets made or doesn’t get made people are going to be pissed and want something else. I’m just hoping that we get this vaccine sooner rather than later because honestly, that’s the only way life will ever return to normal like it or not.",1

Students also don't ""ruin"" a school. Policy does. Phrasing it like ""issues common to the lower class"" makes it sound like you wrote this in men's flats and a powdered wig.

&gt;If Boston was willing to take the lower 20% and stick them in special schools that can handle the issues common to the lower class, the other 80% of students would at least have Quincy-quality schools.

You mean if Bostonians were able to fund a host more of schools and programs instead of shutting them down, sure, but that would require hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars over a short term; something we should have spent already but haven't and which likely can't be resold to an uncaring public.

This outlook indicated that below-average temperatures in parts of the south-central and southeastern United States would be favored, with above-average temperatures favored in the western U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and New England.

That's not what makes it racist. Did your other accounts here get banned or something? Disparities in racial achievement highlight racism. To use those results is racist.

"All of this is speculation. I think 1 may make some difference, though so hard to really know. 2 may be somewhat true but not nearly enough to explain the magnitude of the mortality difference. (Essentially all the treatments we have make a small difference, if that. Just recently saw an RTC showing remdesivir has no effect and that’s the only FDA approved treatment. Steroids probably help some but again, not enough to explain such a massive decrease in mortality.) As for 3, the studies actually show mortality down across all age groups so don’t think that’s playing a role. 4 could play a huge role, but I think that would be more likely there is some as yet undiscovered genetic predisposition to severe COVID, rather than who we typically think of as vulnerable, as again, these people with typical risk factors (is age, diabetes, obesity, etc) are doing significantly better than previously.

I think such a huge magnitude of difference suggests a change in either virus or host factors, and I think we just don’t know yet, and maybe never will. I do know we have a tendency to attribute all change to human action, whereas I think much of the dynamics of this virus may be out of our control.",1

"No? There's only one thing that went wrong: someone accidentally made an elevator do weird shit, and after it did weird shit, *she kept messing with it.* She wasn't ""carrying"" a package, she was trying to cram a huge package into the elevator.

She stuffed an oversize package into the elevator, it tripped the door interlock switch, the elevator moved but stopped (presumably the package shifted as the elevator went down) and then she messed with the package a bunch more, causing the sensor to trip again, and the elevator to move again. The description isn't super specific, but I'm guessing she was trying to pull or push on the package, and when the elevator suddenly resumed going down, taking the package with it, she fell in through the open door...or she was hanging onto the package, the package was pulled out of the elevator, and then she was yoinked into the shaft.

Most sane people, when an elevator does something unexpected and end up in a decidedly non-normal state, go ""oh shit, well this is above my pay grade, time to call someone.""

There's a well known security hacker who does exploits involving elevators and he always starts his talk with a safety speech, and the tldr is: **elevators operating in normal mode are incredibly safe for anyone in the cab. If anything goes wrong in an elevator, stay the fuck where you are, and call for help.**

 He continues on to say that there are lots of injuries and deaths involving elevators, but none of them involve people who were fully in the elevator cab, doors closed. The injuries and deaths almost always involve people outside (ie on top of) the cab, or forcing doors open, or trying to get in or out of an elevator that is clearly malfunctioning (like the doors not fully open/closed or the elevator not fully arrived at the correct level.) Basically: people inadvertently trip interlocks in the process of getting in/out, or the interlocks were failing and intermittent...the elevator moves, and the person gets squished.",1

The whole ""DM me the description and I'll give them back to you"" plays into this too. They want to be the person to hand them back to the owner so they get the ""thank you"" that makes them look and feel good. Otherwise they could have easily made a Reddit post with the picture of the keys saying that they are now at the Brookline police station, or were placed back where he/she found them. There are plenty of other ways that this could have been handled that would have given the lost keys more visibility and exposure, but given OP's vehement defense of his/her post along with the hostile and sarcastic responses to others' suggestions, I can't see any other plausible reason.

&gt;&gt; This thinking is in line with the conventional wisdom that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000 because of the razor-thin margin between the two major party candidates in Florida. Of course, such logic falls apart when you consider that almost 13 times as many registered Florida Democrats voted for George W. Bush as they did for Nader, and that [liberals-for-Bush exceeded Nader's](https://reason.com/blog/2016/08/03/ralph-nader-did-not-hand-2000-election) total vote by a factor of more than three. [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/)' exit poll posed the hypothetical question of who third party voters would support if the race were only Clinton and Trump, and both Johnson and Stein supporters appeared to support Clinton over Trump by about 25 percent to 15 percent. But 55 percent of Johnson's supporters would have just sat out the election, as would 61 percent of Jill Stein supporters. According to [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html) exit polling, a whopping 63 percent of voters who declined to cast their ballot for the two major party candidates said they would have not voted at all in a two candidate race.

I always found qPCR with fecal-containing samples to be very noisy. There's just a lot of contaminants (I think it was different polysaccharides) at random concentrations that inhibit polymerases at different levels and carried through the nucleic acid extraction with the appropriate kits. Adding in everything else that comes with wastewater (other biologics, total water usage, weather, etc.) and all the factors that can affect viral stability (detergents, pH, temperature, etc.), a single gigantic point may just be a weird outlier, like the one above 100 at the start of September. In this case, also, at the raw data: 

Date|South|North
:--|:--|:--
10/14/2020|103|71
10/16/2020|105|101 
10/18/2020|106|214 
10/19/2020|227|109 

North doubled to 200 and then fell back to 100, followed by South doubling from 100 to 200. 100 is still a concerning level, but it's not the eye-popping three-fold increase of the 60-70 level we were seeing earlier in the month.

It's easy to make policy promises you don't plan on keeping, but personel is policy and I would trust his unity commission promises a lot more if there were progressives in his cabinet. He seems far more willing to reach out to neoconservatives than progressives or even trump supporters, unless you think trumpers are a fan of John Kasich and Jeff Flake.

On top of that, his outright refusal to ban fracking is deeply disappointing and I'm not a fan of all the saber rattling with Iran that's been going on. 


I do want to say that there are things he is proposing that I like, and he's definitely better than Trump, but I don't trust him to be anything more than the ""nothing will fundementally change"" president. I'd be happy to be proven wrong.",1

I say, have a restricted schedule for special needs children to be in person with select staff, keep the rest of the kids remote and work to improve remote learning. 

For children, remote learning is a terrible option but really the only viable one. In fact, remote learning is less effective for *anyone*, but more effective than some kind of rolling in-person procedure.",1

"&gt; If truly left is full-on government ownership of the means of production (of everything), Sanders doesn’t even make the middle-school JV team

""left"" as a political model is of less value than ""how he compares to other countries' governments,"" because the argument was whether or not Sanders and/or Biden is far left or center left or center right in a specifically political context. that requires a primary comparison to other governments, not a theoretical model. 

&gt; A bunch of comparisons to countries I never mentioned is also irrelevant. If full on left is, let’s say, North Korea, (yes, I know, totalitarianism /= communist, that’s a different discussion) then let’s not pretend that a politician pushing for single-payer healthcare is somehow out of mainstream of human society or radical.

my point was that Sanders is pushing for a single payer healthcare system that eliminates private insurance that duplicates government service, covers vision and dental, and is free at the point of use. that *is* a radical proposal. he is not pushing for the single-payer healthcare systems enacted by the countries often cited as their models (namely Scandinavia, Western Europe, and the Anglosphere). single-payer as implemented in the UK or Canada looks *very* different from his specific version of M4A. 

moreover, you did bring up those countries, by virtue of the fact that in your original comment, you stated that ""Biden Is objectively a bit right of center in a global political context. Even Sanders is only slightly left of center from that frame of reference."" a global political frame of reference must include the global spectrum of countries - including conservative countries (and I even discounted, off the bat, any straight theocracies).

&gt;  they find our healthcare system bewildering and demonstrably inferior to the range of circumstances they enjoy in their home countries. [...]  Expecting that the most powerful nation on earth could do a little better is not radical, it’s common sense. Using an existing program’s framework as the basis for “a little better” is not radical either, it’s also common sense… and dare I say, conservative.

my objections in the first place were not about ""no one should ever reform healthcare in the US,"" they were about Sanders's specific plan to do so. the current system could be improved, nor have I ever disputed that. you yourself acknowledge that there is a range of healthcare that your coworkers have enjoyed in their home countries, and many of those systems enjoy objectively better standards of care, lower tax burden, and are more appealing to the American population. a public option is the universal healthcare system in a huge portion of Europe: Biden would not be center right. banning private insurance and private hospitals would be a radical move well outside the boundaries of most social democracy and labour parties. 

changing healthcare policy =/= M4A. doing better =/= M4A. (also, as any healthcare system change would, in fact, be a huge overhaul, it is definitely not conservative.)",1

"&gt;I don't deny that time and distance are a factor. I *do* deny that the virus is only transmitted if you're within 3 inches of an infected person, which is literally what you said and what you're continuing to stand by.

Try and quote me. I find your hyperbole pretty useless to further this discussion. 

&gt;In addition to time and distance, there is evidence that airborne particles can be moved by HVAC systems in such a way that people become infected. Yes, it's ""just"" three cases, but how many cases are there - with peer-reviewed evidence - of an infected individual visiting a place with an HVAC system, spending some time there, and not infecting others? I'll gladly accept peer-reviewed evidence of this. To my knowledge, none exists. As such, and again, because I have to take a medication that suppresses my immune system, I'm operating with caution.

That means nothing about the virus being infection-capable - this is something that is regularly brought up by the experts who debate this. Which is also why there's only a handful of incidents regarding airborne spread that have been verified. Do I need to bring up the fact that the medical community has been doing nothing but looking at this virus for 9-10 months and they only verified that handful of incidents? I mean I don't know how to tell you this, but the vaccine isn't really going to .. guarantee much of anything. It might cut an already miniscule risk in.. half? You're going to go from being cautious to ... not caring after 50% better odds? If you were cutting certain death in half, I'd see a point. You're cutting 0.0001% in half. I could be off by a factor of 10, but I'd still not see the point of cutting that in half. (If you do the math out.. before your die... which is related to the IFR, you need to get infected... and before that... you need to meet an infectious person... likely ... yes... close up, for a long time). How did you live your life not worrying about ALL of the other diseases... and get so caught up on ONE?


&gt;There are at least a dozen hospitals in Florida with no ICU capacity. Not including the DOZENS with only a couple of beds left. There are entire counties without a single ICU bed available. Were you one of the Republicans eating up that rhetoric about death panels killing Granny a few years ago? Cuz I got news for you. Eventually - they've only fully reopened for a few weeks - they're going to have to triage these patients and decide who lives and dies. I'm not wasting my time looking at GA or TX because you have absolutely zero intentions of taking in any information that threatens your worldview.


Lord have mercy... out of how many hospitals is that? 50? 100? Florida literally re-opened to full capacity and for large events. And that's it? Do you also know that the hospitals run at like 85% ICU capacity as per the norm? And that some patients in there are there out of an overabundance of caution and could be moved out for COVID critical patients, if necessary? Source: random doctors talking about this on the Internet. What's the problem? Where's the wave of death? It's not here. Thankfully. Don't tell me to wait two weeks, either. :)


&gt;Your Sweden claim is patently false. Sweden has the 12th highest per-capita death rate in the world. In fact, Sweden and the US, which has never had broad regulations, make up a unique category of two - the only two nations in the world that have failed to reduce mortality rates over the course of the pandemic. You, or whoever you're getting your information from, is also cherry-picking comparisons - Swedish schools shut down when Massachusetts schools did, for example, even if bars never closed. Sweden's death rate is significantly higher than neighboring countries - a much better comparison than to the US.

Which is pretty impressive, isn't it? They are supposed to be #1 by a factor of TEN? Imperial college predicted 80,000 dead Swedes? Only 6,000 died.

For quick reference. It's old but illustrates that point. 

No lockdown. Minimal restrictions. Think about it. You know what else is interesting? They are slowly dropping out of the top 10.. then top 15... Hmm. So, what good are these lockdowns/masks if without them you still beat places with strict COVID rules? 


&gt;Yep, the virus has a ~3% death rate, much lower than initially feared. It can still completely overwhelm our hospitals if we let it burn through the population.

Pardon? The virus has a death rate for all of 0.13 - 0.25%. If you are quoting 3%, you are stuck in CFR land. The WHO just peer-reviewed a paper from a statistician/biologists's  (John Ioannidis ) that purports the IFR at 0.25%, but claims this is still likely too high. 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8843927/Just-0-05-healthy-70s-Covid-19-die-disease-study-claims.html

My friends, you are so far off base here... even after you said you knew the difference between the IFR and CFR? I guess maybe you meant broadly.. oh well. 

&gt;how are we still locked down???? What is locked down???? Restaurants are open for indoor dining. Bar seating is open. Movie theaters, open, gyms, open, salons, open, indoor skating rinks, open. Like - what are you upset about, exactly???? Our unemployment rate decreased by 4.9% in August alone. With even more restrictions lifted in September and October, we should be making great progress towards economic normalcy. I think we're striking a great balance in this state, keeping our hospitals operating normally while reopening almost everything.

It's getting better, but the ""order food with drinks"" non-sense is silly. At this point I would also say the useless maskarading in those purely voluntary places needs to go. I'm fine with 75% capacity limits, too, just to pacify some people. Transit/bus masking? Hell, grocery store masking? Fine. I've had it with the debbie downer buzzkill of ""mask walking"" to the bathroom at restaurants though. 

So yeah, if Florida can open and things are OK. We can too. Fully. Open. Like they did a full month ago. I'd bet our combined T-cell and B-cell immunity threshold level is probably higher here than in FL because of how hard MA got hit in February (well before March lockdowns). Want to read about that? This is currently.. seemingly being debated (the t-cell immunity part).. but here it is:

&gt;T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in unexposed people; however, the source and clinical relevance of the reactivity remains unknown. It is speculated that this reflects T cell memory to circulating ‘common cold’ coronaviruses. It will be important to define specificities of these T cells and assess their association with COVID-19 disease severity and vaccine responses.

"I  haven't seen this posted on the sub yet, it seems like quite a few  people saw/had an interaction with these people recently around Boston Common and Back Bay.

*Full Post Text:*

PSA: Regarding Sexual Assualt, Rape, and Sex Trafficking. If you are a  parent, a young adult, or anyone who has a few minutes. Please read  this.

This is something I debated posting about due to the sensitive nature  but I think its too important not to share and get the word out to as  many people as possible. 

Over the weekend, my 2 friends and I took a day trip to Boston MA.  While everyone was masked up, the parks were still pretty filled up and  everyone seemed to be enjoying the day and going about their own things.  As we were walking through a park, I noticed that these 2 gentlemen (in  the picture) had walked in front of us and start talking to these 2  younger girls (early 20’s) we had been walking behind for maybe 5  minutes prior. These girls clearly had no idea who these guys were and  the girls definitely were not showing interest in pursuing a  conversation (Guys were asking questions like “where do you live, etc”).  Immediately I got a very bad feeling and suggested to my friends that I  intervene, however they suggested we just keep following them and see  what their intentions were. After keeping a distance but keeping an eye  on the 2 girls, we noticed there was a 3rd gentleman also in the same  group who was trailing behind them. Overall just very unnatural  behavior. We waited another 2 minutes until I decided to finally butt in  and try to get these girls out of this clearly awkward and unsettling  situation. I walked up behind the group of 2 girls and yelled out “Hey  Jammie, how are you!!!”. This immediately prompted the guys to walk off.  (Another red flag). You could see the fear in these girl’s eyes and  they couldn’t stop thanking my friends and I for looking out for them  and helping them out of the situation. They walked with us until they  felt safe enough to go off on there own again. We thought that would be  the end of our fun. But It wasn’t. These guys were clearly on a mission.  

We spotted them again, this time, one of the guys targeted a single  young woman who was walking alone. Once again. It was clear she did not  know this man and was not comfortable with the situation. This time, we  didn’t have a great way to intervene. This guy knew we were following  them and they all knew what we looked like. We continued however to  trail behind them as they walked with this girl. We didn’t want to lose  sight of them. As time progressed and my friends and I got more uneasy  about the situation, I called the police. I was on the phone with the  operator updating her of the guys (and girl) every movement,street  change ect. All while doing our best to keep a distance. Within 5  minutes we got 2 police cars to our exact location and 4 officers to  assist with the call. They got sight of the gentlemen and set up  officers at each exit of the park to see where they headed to next.  (Corner of Newbury Street). 

Unfortunately, we don’t know how the situation unfolded from there.  But we informed the officers of everything that occurred over the course  of the hour and did everything we could to make sure these girls were  safe. It was the most unsettling experience I’ve witnessed. I wanted to  write about this to keep the conversation going that things like this  happen. For all we know, these guys could’ve killed those young girls.  Who knows what could’ve happened. The important thing is that if you see  something, please say something. You might just save someone’s life in  the process. The movies we see regarding sex trafficking and things like  that might not be as far fetched as some people think. The first 2  girls we helped out were from New York. They clearly had no idea how to  leave the situation they were in. They were in a public park, with many  people around. This can happen anywhere. So be aware of your  surroundings. Don’t be afraid to ask someone to come with you to an  unknown place. We need to stick together to keep each other safe. What  we witnessed that day was what felt like pure evil. And I hope those  guys get what they deserve. Thank you to the Boston Police Dept. for the  incredible response time and for taking our call as seriously as we  did. You may have saved a life.",1

"People enter LTC facilities to rehabilitate from a procedure until they're self sufficient again. That's what long term care means, it means you require a bed longer than the hospital is willing to provide one... LTC facilities often stipulate that their admissions require a minimum stint in an ICU at a hospital, they're not just taking in 97 year olds who've given up on life,.

People in LTC facilities aren't happy because they're people who were recently healthy enough to be independent, and are desperate to recover and get back to their normal lives.

They're 60 year olds who had a hip replacement that got infected during surgery and need time to heal. Or a 45 year olds who had throat surgery and are building their strength back up to get medically cleared to fly back home.

There's typically an older population at LTC's as they need more time to recover from operations, but they're not invalids, they're not in hospice, they're trying to heal and go home.

The Minuteman bike trail is very nice but be respectful of the cyclists. I also enjoyed the Somerville/Cambridge Community Bike Path when I lived off of it, and the easy access it gives to places like Fresh Pond. 

Charlestown, Beacon Hill and the North End are also incredibly enjoyable to walk around for the architecture, I even sometimes follow the Freedom Trail just for the fun of it. 

Might be unpopular here, but I honestly enjoy walking through Downtown Crossing on Washington Street, huge fan of pedestrianized streets and Washington Street fits the bill!

As for views oriented, Deer Island has incredible views of Boston, the harbor islands, the ocean, Winthrop and Logan. Revere Beach is also good for plane spotting and waterfront views, as is the waterfront in Lynn and Swampscott. 

The Fells are great if you want to be in a forest, and also gives plenty of good views! Best trails include the Rock Circuit Trail, Skyline Trail and Reservoir Trail. Horn Pond in Woburn is also nice and can give you a good view of Boston from the top of the ""mountain.""

Way back when those buildings were built the streets were full of street cars and people walked from the cars to the stores and then to home. At the time they were called taxpayers because the assumption was they were temporary and would eventually be replaced with multi stories. After automobiles came to dominate the landscape nobody wanted to build Multi story buildings because they would bring more competition for parking spaces and the shops need the spaces for their customers. The guy who does the city beautiful YouTube channel made this point about strip malls. I think he’s right and it applies to the older streetcar line shops as well. It doesn’t make me furious; what I like about it is that it makes greater Boston a walking environment. Without too many exceptions our streets are lined with houses and shops instead of lined with parking lots.,1

"From my family and friends in North Dakota, it’s likely not because of Sturgis. The levels of mask wearing sound almost nonexistent other than national chains that require it. I’ve heard many attitudes spanning from “it’s not significantly worse than the seasonal flu” to “I’m going to get it anyway, so I just need to get treated quicker” to the popular “my diner employees can decide whether they want to wear a mask or not.” I also know two North Dakotans who tested positive after attending a wedding with over 250 people. 

Unfortunately, hospital beds are almost entirely used up: https://www.kxnet.com/news/local-news/north-dakota-hospitals-are-nearing-capacity-for-icu-beds/

More nurses could help unlock some unstaffed hospital beds in the state. But when so few people are taking the precaution of wearing masks, and 250 people weddings are still happening, it has to be frustrating. (which is precisely what I’ve heard from multiple healthcare professionals in the state)",1

He either wants to be where we are or in full lockdown (which he’d do once it gets out of hand). It is completely against what the experts are telling him needs to be done and what they’ve been telling him through the summer as well. It’s always been 4 things. Stop indoor dining, shift all schools to online, and reduce gatherings to 10 or less, and stop other avenues where people can gather indoors and be in close proximities for long periods of time (movie theaters, sports, gyms, etc).

With those measures in place, there’s an astronomically low chance of covid getting out of hand in our state but he’s content with how many are getting sick right now and not willing to make the tough calls that would force some of the more inconsiderate to reel it in so everyone can stay safe.

No Kennedy had ever lost in Massachusetts. People thought it was a forgone conclusion that Kennedy would beat Markey badly and that he should simply step down to avoid embarrassment. Sunrise were a major player in Markey's campaign and they've been transformative in many campaigns around the country.

1. The GOP has less than no chance and spending money on the race is simplu wasting money. They're going to be vastly inderfunded in the srate compared to others so they have to choose their battles.

2. People don't like to lose. Even if the GOP thanks they mighr have a shot in hell, it's difficult to find a lamb for slaughter.

3. The position isn't worth the battle. Register of probate for example in Somerville. A dem is gonna win, it holds no political power so why spend the money?",1

"Essential what it would allow is you or your mechanic to access your vehicle sensors wirelessly. So currently you need a scan tool. The cheap ones can pull ""Code"" which tells you a general error. (Like $20)

P0301 is a misfire on cylinder 1. Now that is very general. That can be caused by a bad sparkplug, a bad ignition coil, low fuel pressure, faulty wires, a bad crank sensor, etc. Etc. 

Now an midrange or expensive tool $200-$5000 tool can read the direct sensor data. So you can see that cylinder one is not getting proper fuel pressure, so more than likely that would be a fuel injector. 

You would now be able to do that with an official phone app. One that manufactures can't lock that data out of. Which they like to do from time to time. 

The official diagnostic computers are dealer only. So every few years the makers of the third party tools have to reverse engineer the software on the car to make the tool usable on that car. That makes them expensive. 

On some cars a simple task like replacing a brake caliper(A hydraulic clamp that squeezes the brake pads onto a rotor to stop you.) You have to plug in a diagnostic computer to bleed the lines after. (Air can compress so in a hydraulic system that's not good.)

The fear is also that now that cars can be updated remotely, the manufacturer can lock out the third party tools from looking at sensor data when ever they want.",1

Sure, Charlestown and Southie and “North” Dorchester are no longer like 100% second-gen Irish with a few Poles thrown in, but it’s largely because Irish-Americans have also moved out to the suburbs.

"One Massachusetts State Police captain, alcohol on his breath and an open beer bottle rattling around his unmarked cruiser, led Saugus police on a chase and had to be wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.

All of these troopers are on patrol today, having escaped termination from the state’s largest law enforcement agency despite crimes or serious misconduct.

A Globe review of the department’s internal affairs files shows the agency rarely fires troopers almost no matter what they have done. The Globe found only a handful of examples of firings in the last decade.

Meanwhile, dozens of troopers found by internal investigators to have broken the law remain on the force today. They collectively have 29 sustained charges for assault and battery; 19 alcohol and drug violations, including four OUIs; 17 charges for harassment, including three for sexual harassment; another 17 for improperly using the state’s criminal background check system.

Another trooper was caught providing unauthorized police escorts for funeral processions and taking cash under the table, while also routinely skipping portions of detail and overtime shifts for which he was paid.

And then there is the trooper duo — academy classmates and close friends — who regularly hung out with known criminals. One trooper traveled and partied in Las Vegas with people tied to organized crime, coming under federal scrutiny after he admitted he improperly ran background checks on behalf of drug dealers linked to an illegal gambling operation.",1

"For as much as people wanna crap on red apple farm for being touristy or whatever, apparently, they have some of the best cider donuts and fudge in the state.  I'm not saying it's *the* best, but it's damn good.",1
Hopefully she’ll land a gig at a station that isn’t a complete dumpster fire.,1
Stop biting your nails my dude. They are fucked,1
"Charge for each person that steps on the orchard?  I could go ON and on and the apples are twice the price of other orchards.  

Last time I went we waited in line for over an hour for food - didn't have time to pick and I tried to just buy apples for a pie to bring home.  

Three employees (it's run by kids) couldn't find and didn't know where to get apples -- there were some apples but they were for ""display"".   

I've been to about 75-85 orchards through out New England and this one is in the bottom quarter for sure.",1

What the fuck is natural gravy 🤨,1
It's chinese bus charters. There has been actual gun battles between companies.,1
"lol they do not charge for each person that steps onto the orchard.  I'll caveat that with maybe they are doing that this year, but I have been many, many times living out there and you get charged per bag of apples.  You want one bag to fill between you and your 4 friends, go nuts.  

I agree that it is a zoo these days - they've become quite popular and there are likely better orchards around the state.

Also, the rest of your experience description sounds nothing like what their day to day ops are. Idk what to tell ya there.  Maybe you went on a bad day.",1

"No read carefully. The problem is that he would have to transport the bus to NJ to fix the door and hire a truckbed to transport it. If they let him fix the brakes in Mass, then drive the bus to NJ to repair the door, then it would've been fine. But due to shitty regulation made by people who are not in the industry, he's not allowed to fix the breaks in Mass, drive it to NJ and fix the door there. 

I think it's kinda stupid the regulations won't let him do that.",1
Boston has a housing issue because they won’t build larger buildings with affordable normal sized apartments and houses in the already developed areas. There needs to be taller buildings. They already rezone single family lots in the suburban neighborhoods and make multi family condos. They’re massive. And quite frankly not affordable to anyone that doesn’t have a combined income of 400k. 600-800k condos. The new apartments rents are in the high twos. They throw up McMansions and McMansions condos all over. Unfortunately if you’re middle class or don’t enjoy living pay check to pay check it’s a no go.,1
"Plus, it's great training strategy to add lots of minor inconveniences to your training runs. Then, when it really matters, you get to go for a single run without them all and it feels like the most convenient run of all time.",1

"I went to Red Apple Farm when it only had one sign on the road. The food was served on a personal grill with a cardboard sign with prices. There was a tree with over 100 grafts of different apples on it. And there was a little shed selling trinkets. You got your bag from a girl in a wooden booth and there was probably only two or three cars there.

Then after a few years, I took my parents who were in town and the tree was knocked down in a storm and replaced with the modern kitchen grill stand. There was a petting zoo that never existed before. There was a fake barn rental building hosting a wedding at the time. And people everywhere.

It was a serious culture shock. I had no idea where it all came from.",1
I know.  I went there in college in the 1980s.   The last time I was there was 2 or 3 years ago and it was ruined for me - but - some people LOVE it.,1

"I've been going to this farm for the past 11 years, only once interrupted.

I've never gone this late. Are there still lots of apples? I could eat a half dozen sugar donuts myself in the ride home.",1
"I think Is'Original tastes better with stronger and more complex flavors. They will also make it very very spicy if you ask them to. I crave it often and haven't had a bad dish from there. 

Rod D by Sitti is good but a little more bland and feels like it is made in a way to be inoffensive to people new to thai food. I've also asked them to make it ""spicy level 20 thai spicy"" and it is barely warm. It felt like they are use to a customer base who doesn't want heat.",1

It’s for the garbage guy to pick up maybe,1
Are you being sarcastic?,1
"Blue Hills suffers from this. If you aren’t going to pick it up, take a stick and knuckle puck it into the woods off the path. If you already bagged, carry it with you. You already felt the heat of that fresh loaf and a big whiff.",1

"If the kite is intact and the lines are not tangled , it’s very easy to relaunch it from the water. It doesn’t need to be dried out. Usually the beginners have to swim until they get the skills.",1
"No. If someone is choosing to be a bum and not pick up their dogs feces, then the very least they could do is use something to move it off the trail.

If you already bagged, take it with you and throw it out. There’s no point to leave bagged poop behind. People that bag their dog’s feces and then leave it on the trail, are morons. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of people like that here.",1
No psychedelics on the drug question?,1
"No! Instead of just not bothering and leaving it out to the elements to dry out in the sun and wash away in the rain, it’s best to half-do the job and wrap it in a plastic sarcophagus that will protect it for weeks and weeks until someone else comes and picks it up for you.",1

imagine breaking a bone and just being told sorry theres no doctors",1
"Yes that’s a huge issue. My insurance happens to cover weekly therapy appointments permanently. I only go every other week now, but I definitely couldn’t afford it otherwise.",1
the formality of wrapping it in plastic before placing it back on the ground is so baffling lmao just say you like touching shit and go,1
