I tested positive for antibodies way back in may. I was sick with what I thought was the flu in February. Fast forward to about a month ago - I had swelling in my leg. I thought I pulled a muscle or something. I finally went to urgent care when it became unbearable and they sent me to the ER. I had a blood clot in my leg and it travelled to my lungs. Doc still doesn‚Äôt know what caused it but they suspect it‚Äôs complications from covid as there is no other explanation. I was in critical condition in the ICU. I was in the hospital for four days. I‚Äôm out now and on blood thinners (prob for the rest of my life) and unsure of my fate as there are still clots in my lungs.

"Checking in on people's thoughts of NY1 in 2020. It is not the local news network it was in the 1990s. And is it just me, or is the network giving too much attention to right wing talking points? Last week, Trump falsely claimed that the vaccine was coming this week, and NY1 reported it as fact. Stenography is not journalism. And today, they have a story on the anti-Cuomo protest outside of Mac's pub in Richmond County. That's way too much attention to the fringe. And of course Charter/Spectrum is just an evil corporation. They are supporting the packing of the FCC with Trump appointees who will remain through Biden's first term. And of course we have the [ongoing age and gender discrimination suit led by Shaughnessy and Lee](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3az8p9/they-shun-us-in-the-newsroom-ny1-women-who-sued-for-discrimination-say-theyre-facing-retaliation). Pat Kiernan is more of a conservative than we knew. And Jamie just sucks. So we're left with Wills, the night crew, Adame, Anika, Shaughnessy and Lee.   


My question is - has anyone been able to quit NY1? As charming as In The Papers is, can you still watch a news channel that isn't rally news anymore? Thanks for reading my rant.",0
"We recognize the impact of both COVID-19 and COVID restrictions on our community and that discussion about both things is relevant to the subreddit. That said, we do not want to interfere with lifesaving public health measures during a pandemic and we are not a science- or medicine-related subreddit. To that end, we have instituted the following rules:

COVID can be talked about in the following ways and others:

*    How COVID or COVID measures impact you personally
*    What COVID rules are and how they have changed
*    NYC related COVID news or personal experiences
*    Whether shutdowns are timely and/or otherwise sufficient
*    What specific masks to use and how to safely travel around the city

Examples of comments we will not tolerate:

*    Whether masks or social distancing are necessary (or effective)
*    Whether the COVID pandemic is really a public health threat
*    Conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, about public health measures, or about vaccines
*    Advocating noncompliance with public health guidelines or shaming others for folowing them

These lists are incomplete and moderators will use our best judgement.

You may not agree with these guidelines as these issues are important to all of us in NYC, but we are not a science subreddit and we cannot police the spread of misinformation and inappropriately interpreted scientific literature on a fine scale.

"Hi All,

So, I think I screwed up and looked at an apartment (and applied) for something I \*thought\* was a no-fee apt, but I'm now realizing the apartment that was listed online is not actually the apartment they showed me (same line, different place). I can't even find THAT apartment on StreetEasy... 

Does anyone know what's happening with broker fees right now? In this case, the broker has a relationship with the landlord and I think might actually help me instead of just pushing paperwork around, but I really am going to have trouble shelling it out.  I've gotten lucky and never had to pay a broker fee before. I know REBNY challenged the ""landlord pays the fee"" back before COVID and, as far as I know, it's still tied up in court so... broker fees stand. Can you negotiate a fee down to 1 month's rent? Less?

Also, can you pay broker fees with credit cards or anything else like that? I just don't have the cash lying around to throw at a broker right now.  Has anybody gone through this recently?

Thanks much for any advice!",0

"1 more month of 2020 left. March seems so far and near at the same time. Been a hectic year, people moved out of the city/ into the city, switched to remote work/school. 


With the year coming to an end what are people's reflection on life and (tentative) plans for 2021?


For those that moved out of the city for whatever reason*:


What are your housing plans for the first few months of 2021? When do you plan on returning to NYC (if at all, and if not, why not)? What were the variables motivating your decision to return to NYC or not?


*With millions of people, sure there are a many reasons why people moved out, whether it is due to losing their job, saving money in a lower cost place, staying with family etc. We've all read threads that turn into heated arguments about ""true New Yorkers"" and non-constructive finger pointing about ""leaving."" Let's keep away from that.


For those that moved into the city:


How have you been liking/or not liking it so far?


Work/School:


Any updates on your companies/school return to work/office/school?


I hear most university are still sticking with the online classes for the Spring 2021 semester.

"**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* *What's the difference between pop up sites, hospitals, mobile sites, self swabbing sites and point of care? -* Different sites will ask for varying levels of information and offer different tests. Not all rules apply to all sites but generally you can expect mobile sites to be quicker, outdoors, with no insurance information collected but these do not offer antibody testing or rapid testing. Pop up sites can be distinguished by the temporary trailers in a fixed location and will ask for insurance (but it's not needed). Some offer rapid testing and flu shots. Point of care are any of the above sites or its own entity offering rapid testing and results in the same visit. Self-swabbing sites are sites where you register to use a kit that comes with the items needed to swab oneself - better for those who are computer literate.
* *What are turn around times?* \- 1-3 days, not 24-72 hours. What this means is for most sites it doesn't matter if you comes at 9 am or 4 pm because specimens are processed at the end of the day. 
* *Where will you be?* Please look online at [nyc.gov/covidtest](https://nyc.gov/covidtest). Look out for mobile sites or pop up sites or NYC H+H designated locations.
* *What are the lines like*? - Depends on the site. You should expect sites closer to the city to have longer lines. If you have a car driving to another site could be quicker. 
* *What do I need to bring?* All testing should be free and you will not be turned away due to lack of insurance. If you have it please bring your insurance information to stationary sites - mobile sites don't collect",0

I've been wanting to move to NYC for the past few years, and I finally got an opportunity to do so.

"I‚Äôm asking this in NYC subreddit versus finance since I‚Äôm wanting to know what applies specifically to NYC and with so many being small biz owners or self employed, I figured I‚Äôd find the answer.

When purchasing a family home.. say it‚Äôs a 2 level home with a finished basement. It‚Äôs listed as being 1300 sq feet but the basement is ALSO 650 sq feet meaning it totals 1950 sq ft.. if your mortgage (principal/interest), property tax come to $2,800 a month ‚Äî or ‚Äî including all utilities and maintenance we are talking a $4,100 a month .. and you use 90% of the basement for your business entirely (my business is product based so this is realistic.. and I‚Äôd have a corner for the washer dryer).. you‚Äôd be using 30% of the square footage of your house (585 sq feet .. all 3 floors of house are 1950 sq feet so that‚Äôs 30%)

From what I‚Äôve read, for the most part it‚Äôs usually ideal to take the standard deduction of $5 per square foot for 300 sq feet which is $1500 (so that‚Äôs an $18,000 deduction right)?  (If we did it based on 30% of $4100 a month.. that‚Äôs $1230.. so it seems more ideal to take the standard deduction)

What I want to ask is, in your experience if the bottom level of the home is a basement or a garage that was converted to a living space does this count in the overall square footage of the house and is it able to be deducted as so? 

Finished basements and converted garages are more of a thing here so thought I‚Äôd ask. Whenever I see real estate listings I‚Äôll see .. for instance.. a house is listed at 1000 sq feet when there‚Äôs also a 500 sq ft basement below..

"Hello! This may be a shot in the dark, but I have a ny ebt question.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using HRA EBT for several months now (I believe since September or October) as I am a recent graduate as of September 2020 and receive no unemployment because I was only previously an unpaid intern (which is exceptionally bs, but what else would you expect). 

&amp;#x200B;

My account says ""no upcoming payments"" on the Access HRA app. I received my last food stamp and cash assistance payment on November 7th. I believe my food stamp benefits are up for recertification, which I've done. My cash assistance says plainly that I am not due for recertification. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering why my account says there are no upcoming payments? I have tried to get a grasp on this ridiculous process, but I'm still learning.

Thanks!",0

The reason being is that I am leaving my job at the end of the month and my commuter benefits will be totally wiped when I leave. Due to COVID-19 I haven't needed to use them at all since March so I've accrued too much to use in three weeks. Any advice or hearsay would be appreciated!",0

"My entire apartment building and the one across from me has a roach infestation and management is trying their best to make sure nobody knows. I contacted them several times saying we found big roaches in our apartment. I took steps to protect our unit but the battle is lost if they don't find the source and deal with it. They spray compactor rooms...whoopie...the roaches in compactor rooms are an effect of the infestation

So, tonight after printing out many many letters and using half my black ink cartridge describing the roach problem and telling tenants to call management to deal with it I am preparing to go out into the hallways and deliver each letter to every tenant. 

LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN. MANAGEMENT DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW? GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM ALL

On the letter I encourage them to contact 311 and the housing development and preservation department if management continues to not take this seriously.

I'm so excited! It's clobbering time!!!",0

We just moved to NYC and have a 1 year old that we would like to take to daycare.

We are not looking for a full time program, we just want our son to socialize with other kids, learn English (we speak Spanish at home) and get us some adult time. 2-3 days a week for 4-5 hours each day should be fine.

I did some search on the internet and I find all daycare is extremely expensive (over 2000/month) and I didn't see any part time or drop-in options.

What are our options here? Are there any options for us that we haven't thought about?

"So I'm a Canadian who really likes NYC, because it isn't that far away, I can get around no problem, enjoy the restaurants, Central Park, other attractions, etc.

Obviously this question is for a post-Covid scenario.

Each time I've been in NYC, I've stayed in the UWS, either with a friend, or in a nice condo that I rent on occasion. I like the UWS, but is there another area in a different borough that someone could recommend?

The Pros of staying in the UWS are its familiarity (almost feels like coming home to visit an old friend, in a good way), proximity to transit, within walking distance to some great areas in Manhattan.

The Con is, I've seen much of the city south of 90th, and should probably give the other boroughs a chance (or other areas of Manhattan).

Any suggestions?",0

Has anybody else ever used those, or something else? If so, what are your thoughts? Is it worth it?

I always call 311 so that they can send an officer to ticket the vehicle but they never come. The few instances when they do come, it's always takes them around three to five hours. I don't understand what is the point of us having to call 311 to get a car ticketed in order for it to be towed when the police in this city don't do anything when it comes to non emergency calls. In my opinion that law needs to be abolished and homeowners so be free to call a towing company once he or she witnesses their driveway being blocked.",0

"As the title says, I am looking into terminating my lease in Manhattan for a few reasons but mainly a broken radiator whose excessive noise keeps me up at night. I signed a 13 month lease (13th month free) starting October 1st. The real estate agent (outside firm) told me verbally that the only penalty for breaking the lease is losing your security deposit (1 month's rent) and I'm kicking myself that I didn't get that in writing, but it may still stand as she didn't seem shady.

This is the third night in less than two months that the banging noise on the steam pipe that runs floor to ceiling and radiator will keep me up the entirety of the night. It sometimes happens in the day too, it's extremely loud and hard to even be in the unit awake the volume is so disturbing. Almost every time I have contacted the super via text and he has said for over a month now that the feeder, etc. is broken so it's just happening. He also admitted that many other tenants in the 35 unit building have been complaining. He just seems completely over the problem and is in general rude and doesn't always reply. I spoke to the property management's ""construction manager"" about 2.5 weeks ago and he seemed hardly aware of the problem. They're dragging their feet and the noise violates the warranty of habitability for this unit, not to mention that the heat level is extremely excessive in my unit.

Another big issue I have had is they have turned off the water 4 times this month, twice without notice. When it happened the first time the construction manager was apologetic and said he would follow up with the super since it was obviously not okay. The second time was today and I called and spoke to the property manager for the first time who was extremely hostile and told me to just wait it out and that it was probably an emergency and perfectly legal. His demeanor on the phone was so aggressive and threatening that I refused to identify myself by name.

Smaller problems include a hole in the ceiling where the steam pipe runs through. They patched this up once but it continues to drop debris crack further into the room. Not to mention is is an exposed hole. I have seen roaches and mice on the 2nd, 1st and basement levels. I see mice every time I am in the basement for laundry/trash. Thankfully not in my unit but I have seen on 311 other tenants complain of pests in their units. I haven't addressed the pest problem with management as there are multiple 311 complaints out already.

I'm hoping for advice on next steps. I have the service requests and almost all interactions with the super in writing. I really don't think I can make it another 11 months, especially through the winter with this noise problem at night. I also work from home and the noise interrupts my workday/calls. I don't want to have to go to housing court but I really want to get out of this lease ASAP and I'm frankly scared of engaging in a battle as the property owner is a real estate lawyer and all of the other employees have made the whole operation seem like a full blown slumlord operation.

"So I found this absolutely amazing apartment that I fell in love with the moment I stepped inside. I told the broker/real estate agent that I would like to apply for the place, and he said in order to move forward, I have to submit a ""good faith deposit"" of a few hundred to take the apartment off the market and on hold as they start the next part of processing my application. If my application isn't approved, they will send the deposit back. They also said that the money put into the deposit will go into my security deposit once I sign the lease.

This all sounds fine to me, and I really would like to sign for this apartment. However, one of my friends claims that this is illegal and they aren't allowed to ask for money in this way. Yet there's no broker fee and the security deposit is one month's rent (which I know NYC made a law stating that a security deposit cannot be more than one month's rent). Is he right and it's illegal, or am I good to go?

"Hello, first time posting here. I have an idea that I wanted to throw into the wild concerning rat extermination, a persistent issue in NYC.

I'm aware of some creative methods that are used to exterminate rodents in the city. I'm not aware if this idea has been floating around but what about neutering  the rats that was caught and send them back to their habitat. Both male  and female, rats aren't choosy. This increases the rate of unsuccessful  fertilization within the rodents' population, hence declining their  birth rate.

I  argue that this is better than poisoning or killing because those methods  would select stronger rats to procreate which would strengthen the  future rodent population within the city. Together with better sanitation standard from both officials and the people, and various other methods, this might significantly reduce the rats population in the city.

Now for the cons of this idea is that rats are hard to catch let alone being caught alive. So the alternative to this method is to introduce sterile rats that was bred by human into the wild. The sterilization might be done after birth or genetically. Of course this may post other unforeseen trappings, pun intended, feel free to express those thoughts. 

Also I'm aware that both low sanitation standard and the structure of our sewage system throughout history among various other reasons lend itself to be a prime location for rats' habitats.",0

"Hey guys, just some background info. I've lived in the New Jersey suburbs my whole life. I'm a senior in high school and I plan on most likely working in the city after I graduate college with a Computer Science degree. I visited the city yesterday for the first time in years. I was excited and expected to enjoy my time there but I don't believe I got a good impression of it. 

I was driving on the streets for the first time and the traffic there is definitely insane. I managed to get where I wanted to go but it was a nightmare trying to get by. People constantly walking through the streets on red lights, people parking in the middle of the streets, and I saw a crackhead just walking through an active street. When I ended up parking my car, I noticed there were a lot of homeless people as well as their ""beds"". Lots of areas where I went to had a heavy stench of marijuana  (I just really can't stand the smell) and I started getting irritated a lot hearing cars constantly beeping at each other. I have no idea how you guys are able to sleep through the night with all the noise haha.

However, there were some positives. The food is actually really good and there are so many places you can visit in such a small area. The buildings were also absolutely stunning to look at and there's so much detail everywhere. 

Perhaps I got a bad first impression but I guess I'd like to hear from you guys who've lived in NYC your whole life what you like and dislike about it. Also any tips/places I should visit when I visit there next time.

I hope post doesn't make me sound like a negative person or anything. I've been to other cities and loved them but I just didn't enjoy NYC as much as I expected.",0

* How have COVID-19 regulations affected your commute?

"Hey NYC community -- 

I'm hoping someone in this Reddit can steer me toward volunteer opportunities in the city that would be available over the next few months. I've done some Googling but a lot of the resources online are dated to before the pandemic, so they don't account for healthy behaviors or consider the way NYC has changed since March. 

Some context: I've never volunteered before. I am dissatisfied with the selfish mindset that seems so pervasive in our country, and even more tired of my own complaining about it. I'd like to engage with members of the NYC community who need help (safely, of course) and try to make a positive difference in the world. 

The immediate ideas that occur to me are helping with community fridges that have popped up to address food insecurity. Or, I'd like to somehow help an envrionmental cause to combat to overwhelming sense of dread over global warming. I am an experienced writer and sometime athlete capable of moving boxes, transporting materials or writing grants, proposals, etc. 

I don't have a car and work remote every day Monday - Friday. 

Any ideas? 

Thank you.",0

"Soooo ...one of my roommates has decided he's had enough and is getting out Dec. 1st.  We live in a 3 bedroom house and the rent is 3100 split 3 ways. He has already contacted the landlord and told him he is leaving. The landlord hasn't gotten in contact with us yet about it. Just wondering what is acceptable in this situation. I'm planning on asking if we can pay 2000 until February first since that's the earliest I forsee someone being able to move in. I'm really trying to avoid having to rush someone in who will not be the right fit. We have lived here 6 years and never been late on rent or asked for anything except a hole in the roof patched.  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this or any input on if this is even an acceptable ask?   All advice is welcome.

We have a new account number.

I don't know why she couldn't have thought of something else to put me on??? Like idk, the internet bill???? She knew that the account number would change and that we would probably lose whatever was giving us $20 electricity bills. Bill came out to $60 this month and she's upset. üôÑüôÑüôÑ

I don‚Äôt go in their way, I focus on where I‚Äôm headed but they always come up to me. I‚Äôm not sure what this guy mutters as I can‚Äôt hear him well. He has never threatened me or attacked me. I mostly see him hanging around with a big bag and eating something. I asked my bf who he is and he doesn‚Äôt think the man lives in the building. He says the man hangs there a lot but wouldn‚Äôt ever harm someone. But he says the homeless man may be schizophrenic or bipolar or has something else. My bf always walks downstairs with me when I‚Äôm headed to my car after visiting him, but I don‚Äôt ask him to walk with me when I am going to his place as I don‚Äôt want to seem too paranoid.

Many times, especially in residential neighborhoods and at night, the bicyclists are delivery drivers and they are more likely to be missing high-visibility gear.

I know wait times are probably longer than they were 3 weeks ago but the way NYC Health + Hospitals is set up is much more efficient and you don‚Äôt have to wait for non-testing visits before you. You don‚Äôt have to explain why you are getting tested either. The only issue is that most of the NYC Health + Hospital locations do not have the rapid testing.

"Hi guys, I posted this in /r/Queens and it seemed to have helped some families so I'm reaching out to other subreddits as well. Hope you guys don't mind.

I work with the city via Department of Health to provide Early Intervention services for children under 3 years old. It has come to our attention that this service is extremely underutilized in the city, so I would like more people be aware of this program.

Early Intervention is a family centered program designed to enhance the capacities of families to meet their child‚Äôs needs, with services provided in the child‚Äôs natural environment. For example, if a child is not meeting their speech milestones, then they would receive speech therapy up to five times a week. Other therapies include but are not limited to physical therapy, occupational therapy, special instruction, and Applied Behavior Analysis. In order to receive these services, the child must be evaluated by therapist and trained healthcare providers. It‚Äôs important to note that the program comes at no cost to you and is covered completely either by your insurance or by the state. It is also completely confidential and voluntary, so you are free to opt out at any point in the program.

If any of you guys are interested in getting started with Early Intervention, feel free to DM me so I can assist in the referral. As a service coordinator, my role in Early Intervention is to locate and facilitate the services for your family. You can also call 311 and ask for more information there. Additionally, for more information you can go to https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/early-intervention.page. If you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask!

"I'm an NYC DOE middle school teacher, and I wanted to offer my perspective on this. I will admit that there are certain groups of students that in-person learning works better for. These include pre-k students, elementary school students, and our students with severe disabilities (district 75). Yes, people are right when the say a 6 year old should not be sitting on Zoom for 6 hours a day. I get that. 

Additionally, I will admit that schools are not necessarily the vectors of COVID-19 transmission that we thought they would be. I do not believe the numbers surrounding this, though. My school was ""randomly tested"" a couple weeks ago and they had enough staff volunteers that they did not actually have to randomly select anyone. Also, the only students they tested were those on the first floor because that's all they needed for their sample. That's not really ""random.""

But my question is, why are middle and high schools still open? What's the point? Let me tell you what it's like for students in my school. They are in one room all day long with less than 10 students. Some classes have as few as two or three students on some days. They cannot move from their seat. If they want to go to the bathroom, we need to call for an escort. They must wear their masks all day except for lunch. More importantly, especially now that the weather is getting cold, all windows must be kept wide open at all times for ventilation purposes. Students and teachers are miserable on cold days, and it's not getting any warmer. We are walking around freezing in parkas, hats, and gloves. The heat is blasting and it does not make a difference when the wind is whipping through the windows.

In a school of normally 1,000 students, we have approximately 95 on a daily basis. There are more adults in the building than students. I'm not kidding, that's it. Why are we doing this?  What's the point? Can anybody give me a compelling reason that middle and high schools should still be open?",0

"So to keep it pretty short, my wife and I began working for a merchant cash advance company in Brooklyn about a month and a half ago. For the first week everything was going fairly well. Payroll was fine and the work was exactly as anticipated(I'd worked for similar companies).

Payroll was messed up every week after the first, for one reason or another. It was always blamed on one of the partners. So our boss would Zelle or Venmo us our pay.

We were given W9s to sign, which I believe is for independent contractors. After reading about the difference between being a contractor and an employee, I discovered that regardless of whether we had filled out a W9 or not, we were considered employees according to state and city law. We had a set schedule, direct supervision and all equipment was provided for us among other things.

So fast forward to last Monday. My wife and I were going to be a few hours late so we emailed the boss to let him know which is how he told us to go about this. From day 1 he knew and understood that we are living in a shelter and there may be some time where we would be late or not be able to come in due to numerous appointments and other sporadic issues that would come up related to our situation. 

We come into the office a few hours late as we had said we would be and are immediately called outside to talk. He tells us to go home and call him Friday to let him know what we wanted to do.

Now this is a commissioned sales job, but the pay structure gives us a salary every week if you do not hit any commission. $400 is the weekly salary, $150 of which is a draw against future commissions. So at this point we are owed for 3 full days of work each, which should be $480 by his pay structure, if it were minimum wage it would be $720, but that's later.

Friday comes around and i text him to ask about payroll and our future and i am told we were terminated and no money is owed to us because we owe the company $600 each for the draw for the month we worked. I email him what I could find about commission work in NYC and it says the draw is to be taken only from future commissions and that its discrimination to fire us because of our housing status.

Once he sees that by firing us for being late would mean that we worked a set schedule and would be considered employees, he concocted some story(told to me by a friend that still works there) about my wife contacting his wife to tell her that he was cheating on her with numerous other women and that is why we were fired.

Is there any way I can get the money that is owed to us? I know that he is breaking all sorts of laws with the business besides just labor law. Dragging my wife into this situation is uncalled for.

One New York City police officer was accused of pepper-spraying a woman, then denying her medical treatment while she was handcuffed in a Bronx holding cell.

Another officer slammed a 51-year-old man who had been arguing with some restaurant workers onto the floor, knocking him unconscious, the man said. A third officer was accused of tackling a gay man during a pride parade and using a homophobic slur.

The city‚Äôs independent oversight agency that investigates police misconduct found enough evidence in all three cases to conclude that the officers should face the most severe discipline available, including suspension or dismissal from the force.

But in the end, senior police officials downgraded or outright rejected those charges, and the officers were given lesser punishments or none at all ‚Äî the kind of routine outcome that has left the Police Department facing a crisis of trust in its ability to discipline its own.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very raw thing,‚Äù recalled Zakariyya Amin, who said he was left deeply disillusioned by how the Police Department handled his case involving the incident in the restaurant. ‚ÄúI wake up, still seeing this guy throwing me around, pushing me around.‚Äù

This pattern of lenient punishment holds true for about 71 percent of the 6,900 misconduct charges over the last two decades in which the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, recommended the highest level of discipline and a final outcome was recorded, according to an analysis of recently released data by The New York Times.

In case after case, the records show that the Police Department often used its power over the disciplinary process to nullify the review board‚Äôs determination that serious misconduct had occurred and that the stiffest punishment should be meted out.

The department regularly ignored the board‚Äôs recommendations, overruled them or downgraded the punishments, even when police officials confirmed that the officers had violated department regulations, The Times found. All the while, the city paid millions of dollars to resolve lawsuits from people filing complaints in some of those very same cases.

Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a platform that included reining in police misconduct, but these trends have gone largely unchanged during his stewardship of the department.

The analysis shows that since Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014, the department has overruled the board‚Äôs recommendation in more than half of the cases in which the board sought the most severe discipline.

In the first half of 2019, the police commissioner at the time, James P. O‚ÄôNeill, imposed the penalty recommended by the review board in just three out of the 14 cases the panel prosecuted.

In one of the remaining cases, the Police Department decided to allow an officer to go unpunished after the review board concluded that he had used excessive force in punching a 14-year-old boy. In another case, the department chose not to take action against an officer found to have used a chokehold to lift a handcuffed man off his feet and slam him into a car.

The release of the Civilian Complaint Review Board records comes as police departments across the country are under mounting pressure to remove problematic officers from their forces after the death of George Floyd.

As protests swept the city and nation this summer, both Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea urged the public to have confidence in the city‚Äôs ability to hold officers accountable. But the data offers further evidence of the challenges that outside oversight agencies face in going up against police forces.

Mr. Shea, who was appointed a year ago, has imposed the board‚Äôs recommended penalty in only two of the 28 cases in which charges were brought, records show.

After learning that The Times had inquired about how Mr. Shea has handled misconduct, the Police Department issued a news release last week promoting his record on discipline. It said that under Mr. Shea, the department had made several changes, including adopting disciplinary guidelines that standardize penalties.

‚ÄúWe ask for the public‚Äôs trust ‚Äî and the public must know we are worthy of it,‚Äù Mr. Shea said.

Still, the handling of police misconduct cases continues to roil the city government: On Wednesday, four senior officials at the Civilian Complaint Review Board were laid off abruptly.

The agency described the move as a restructuring meant to expand its investigative muscle, but some employees said the layoffs amounted to retaliation against officials who criticized how the agency responds when the Police Department refuses to cooperate with its inquiries.

A disciplinary system in ‚Äúdisarray‚Äù

The Civilian Complaint Review Board was established in 1993 by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council to address widespread complaints that police officers were operating with impunity, rarely facing consequences for harassment and brutality, particularly in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Residents who believed that they had been subjected to misconduct often felt they had no recourse, which led to a growing resentment of the police.

The Dinkins administration envisioned that the board would be independent of the Police Department, with its own investigators and subpoena power, and would give the public confidence that abusive officers would be held accountable.

But the data, released for the first time in the agency‚Äôs history, instead suggests that the board has become all but toothless. The public can file complaints, but the board, often referred to as the C.C.R.B., has little ability to ensure that officers deemed troublesome or worse will face serious consequences.

‚ÄúWhat is the C.C.R.B. there for, if they‚Äôre recommending stuff and the N.Y.P.D.‚Äôs not listening?‚Äù said Jacob Alejandro, the gay man who said a lieutenant had knocked him to the ground during a Gay Pride parade, in 2014.

The Police Department declined to comment on the instances of misconduct described in this article, citing an ongoing lawsuit challenging the city‚Äôs authority to release additional records. The department would not make individual officers cited in the complaints available to be interviewed.

Assistant Chief Matthew V. Pontillo, who oversees disciplinary policies, disputed the Times analysis and said it was difficult to draw conclusions from the released data.

There were ‚Äúunique factors that make each case different, that you don‚Äôt see in the data, that you would only see if you read the trial decisions,‚Äù he said.

But the Rev. Fred Davie, chairman of the review board, said the Police Department‚Äôs internal disciplinary system had been in ‚Äúdisarray‚Äù for years.

The review board investigates civilian complaints that allege that officers used excessive force, abused their authority or used offensive language and gestures. And in recent years, the panel gained the power to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and false statements by officers.

The board has no power to impose discipline itself and must present its evidence to an administrative judge employed by the Police Department.

Neither does the board have the power to bring criminal charges. That remains the job of state and federal prosecutors, who are empowered to investigate crimes by officers, such as corruption, assault or unjustified killings.

Just 7 officers facing charges were fired

Since 2015, the review board has published statistics in its annual report showing that the Police Department chose not to follow its recommendations in most cases in which the board brought charges.

But with rare exceptions, the names of officers and other details remained secret until this year, when the State Legislature, responding to the nationwide protests against police brutality, repealed a law that had sealed police disciplinary records.

As a result, the review board released a database of civilian complaints that identifies officers and lists allegations against them, as well as the outcomes of cases.

The data is not comprehensive, especially for complaints filed before 2001. What‚Äôs more, information about people who filed complaints, as well as about pending cases, remains largely secret. The Times was able to determine details of cases through other means, including by reviewing lawsuits.

The data provide the most detailed portrait to date of allegations of serious police misconduct resulting in charges since 2001. Some of The Times‚Äôs findings include:

The Police Department followed the review board‚Äôs recommendations less than 20 percent of the time.

The review board brought charges against a total of 3,188 police officers. Some faced multiple charges in connection with one or more complaints.

798 of the officers were eventually put back onto the street by the department after receiving additional instructions, training or warnings; 890 were not disciplined at all.

Fewer than one in five officers received punishments, ranging in severity from one lost vacation day to 12 months of ‚Äúdismissal probation,‚Äù which allows officers found to have committed offenses they could be fired for, like using a chokehold, to keep their jobs as long as they stay out of trouble.

Just seven officers facing charges were fired, and only after being convicted of a crime in state or federal court or after lying to police internal affairs investigators. They include Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who did not tell investigators the truth about his use of a banned chokehold that sent Eric Garner into a death spiral on a Staten Island sidewalk in 2014.

Some officers had multiple findings against them and continued to rise in the department. The city has paid out more than half a billion dollars just since 2016 to resolve lawsuits over these allegations and many like them.

The board is considered to be so weak that some lawyers said they discouraged their clients from filing a complaint. The lack of a finding or punishment against the police officers involved could be used to undercut a lawsuit.

Body-slammed by a police officer

Mr. Amin, who said he was body-slammed by a police officer in 2012, received just that advice from his lawyer.

Zakariyya Amin said he was body-slammed by a police officer in 2012.

‚ÄúHe said that, ‚ÄòAll you‚Äôre going to be doing is wasting your time,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Amin recalled. He proceeded anyway.

Mr. Amin, then 51, said he had been trying to buy a meal for a homeless man at a Coney Island restaurant when he got into an argument with workers, who refused to serve the other man.

According to the complaint, police officers arrived and accused Mr. Amin of disorderly conduct, twisted his arm behind his back, threw him to the ground and briefly knocked him unconscious.

The review board identified the officer as Andrew Schmitt and, based on its investigation, recommended that the department charge him with using excessive force.

But an administrative judge in the Police Department found Officer Schmitt not guilty of the charge after a departmental trial. The city later settled a lawsuit with Mr. Amin for $150,001.

Pepper-sprayed in a holding cell

Priscilla Colon was 50 when she watched police officers arrest a friend of hers on a street corner in the Bronx in 2009. According to her lawsuit, she was handcuffed after asking why her friend was being detained.

Later, in a holding cell at a Bronx precinct, Officer Kevin Carney pepper-sprayed Ms. Colon and told her to ‚Äúfellate‚Äù him, according to court documents.

The C.C.R.B. recommended Officer Carney be brought up on charges of excessive force for his use of pepper spray and abuse of authority for refusing to seek medical attention for Ms. Colon.

He was not disciplined on the force charge. For abuse of authority, the records indicate he was given command discipline, meaning his punishment was decided by his commanding officer.

It is not clear what sanction he received, but at the time, the penalty for command discipline ranged from a verbal warning to 10 lost vacation days. The city later settled a lawsuit and paid Ms. Colon $50,000.

In some cases, the records appear to show the police upholding the review board‚Äôs findings. But in reality, the penalty imposed by the commissioner was still less than the one that the review board requested.

For instance, the review board wanted Officer James Frascatore to forfeit 10 vacation days for tackling James Blake, a prominent retired professional tennis player, in a case of mistaken identity that received significant attention in 2015.

The officer was found guilty at an administrative trial of using unnecessary physical force, but Police Commissioner O‚ÄôNeill cut the penalty to five days.

In 2017, a Bronx sergeant used a Taser stun gun on a pregnant 17-year-old girl who refused to allow officers responding to a call about an argument to enter her family‚Äôs apartment, according to video and court papers.

The department‚Äôs policy says the devices should not be used on ‚Äúobviously pregnant women,‚Äù but a witness recorded the officer using it on the girl, Dailene Rosario, who screamed she was pregnant as several officers attempted to restrain her.

The sergeant, Robert Durst, pleaded guilty to charges brought by the review board and agreed to forfeit 25 vacation days. But Mr. O‚ÄôNeill docked him just 15. The city later paid $250,000 to settle Ms. Rosario‚Äôs lawsuit.

Scott Rynecki, who represented the teenager, said the evidence could not have been clearer ‚Äî and yet, the officer received a penalty that was hardly enough to deter brutal misconduct, a pattern he has seen with other clients.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not exactly sending them a message not to do this again by hitting them with such minimal penalties,‚Äù he said. The system ‚Äòstill needs a lot of work‚Äô

Assistant Chief Pontillo, who helps to develop disciplinary policies, said one reason the two agencies seldom agreed was that the review board‚Äôs investigations were uneven.

When the Police Department declined to follow the panel‚Äôs recommendations, he said, it was often because the review board had overcharged an officer, failed to produce enough evidence or did not take into account all the circumstances.

He said the department was more likely to follow the board‚Äôs recommendations when it recommended lesser discipline, partly because harsher discipline could hinder police officers‚Äô careers.

‚ÄúThe mere fact of having a substantiated civilian complaint, that can be more significant than any penalty actually imposed,‚Äù Chief Pontillo said.

Andrew C. Quinn, a lawyer who defends police sergeants in misconduct and criminal cases, said he had not been impressed with the review board‚Äôs evidence gathering.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a feel-good agency to say, ‚ÄòHey, look, we‚Äôve got some oversight of the department, a bunch of politically appointed board members and a bunch of inexperienced and incompetent investigators,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

Mr. Davie, the board chairman, acknowledged that the board could improve the quality of some of its investigations but said the Police Department could also do a better job at punishing officers.

The department‚Äôs system has long been haphazard and too dependent on the whim of senior police officials, he said. For those reasons, the department recently proposed a disciplinary matrix to standardize penalties.

‚ÄúThe system was nowhere close to what it needed to be, and it still needs a lot of work,‚Äù he said.

The release of the records has renewed a long-running debate about whether the police commissioner should have sole authority over officer discipline and whether the review board should be able to overrule him.

Chief Pontillo said the commissioner‚Äôs authority is crucial for maintaining control of the force, but Mr. Davie said the entire trial process should be scrutinized.

Civil rights lawyers, elected officials and community activists agreed, saying the department‚Äôs willingness to depart from the review board‚Äôs findings has weakened civilian oversight.

‚ÄúThe N.Y.P.D. has been looking the other way and condoning police abuse routinely and stunningly for decades,‚Äù said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed a public records request to get the data and make it public. ‚ÄúBut I think nobody had any idea how massive and pervasive the failures of accountability were.‚Äù",0

Basically the title. I live in a 3br apartment in a 6 unit building in Brooklyn. Our bill is usually between $30-$80 depending on A/C use and such. Just went in to pay my bill this month and surprised to see that my non-estimated meter reading came out to 45,117 kWh hours. 

The smart meter was installed a couple weeks back and I suspect this is the issue, however I don't understand how to read it (it cycles through multiple settings, one that says 888888 and ""CLOSED,"" another with 21210 - which all the other apartment meters also showed, and then two other settings showing 0.08 and 0.09 with 50 and 60 kWh).

Two days ago, a user posted another call out thread requesting a specific mod be removed from power - https://old.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jsn9g3/another_month_another_thread_about_removing_uqadm/. 

I can no longer access the message because I'm not a moderator any more, but a modmail was sent to us from the mod called out in that thread asking why no one deleted it and how upset he was about it. I made this response: https://imgur.com/a/Srm8VaH 

It doesn't look like anyone else responded that I can tell. 

Then this evening, somehow every mod added after that specific mod was removed. It seems like because we weren't aggressive enough in banning and removing the thread, we were removed from the subreddit, but that's speculative. All mods he could remove - except for the bot mod - were removed. 

So I guess - sorry we nuked the COVID thread because the lack of active participation from the mod in question means you're not likely to get attention. I'd place bets that the election thread is still up in January.

"Hello everyone. I am a new teacher at a Title 1 school district. Over 86% of my students are from low-income households. My 9-10 year old students experience poverty, hardship, distress, and more at such a young age. Their motivation to learn is very tender because they are often discouraged due to their environment.

I see my students for who they are and what they are capable of. My number one goal with my current (and future) students is to ensure literacy. My teacher salary is not enough to afford a classroom library. I make just above the poverty line. The best solution to ensure they have access to thousands of books is with technology. Technology will allow students to receive diverse and relevant reading material that can also meet ALL students at their current reading ability.

Please, if you are capable of donating $1-5 dollars to this campaign it would mean the world to my students and their teacher (me). This is just the difference of getting a grande instead of a venti at Starbucks. Any help counts and I am not asking for much. I just need help reaching this goal and I will scour to the end of the Earth collecting dollars at a time.  **Donors Choose will also double any donations for the next day using code ""LIFTOFF"".** Your $5 donation could become $10 using this code.

Today is World Kindness Day. My students begin each day with social and emotional learning through our morning meeting. I would love to tell them the news that people believe in their education and we received the funds to get an iPad for our classroom. Thank you so much for your consideration. - Ms. Morgan

"My family owns a two family home in NYC. We rent the downstairs apartment and live in the upstairs unit. At the beginning of the year, there were 3 tenants in the rental and everything was fine until Covid hit. We tried to be flex with everyone, offering very low rent or passes on non payment due to the pandemic. Ultimately 2 of the renters moved out and the one remaining person filled the rooms with subletters. Fast forward to a few months later, my husband and I found out we are pregnant with twins and have decided to not renew the tenant lease. We gave ample notice to the person on the lease and she insisted that she would tell the subletters closer to the end of the lease which would be 2 months out. \*\*As a sidenote, she has temporarily moved out of the city so she has not been here and so its only been the subletters residing in the house\*\* The subletters have since been informed that we arent renewing and we are now having an issue with the one person paying rent. They havent paid at all for this month and they are not responding to our emails inquiring. We have made offers to work on payment, but they havent acknowledged any of our emails. They are often coming and going from the house, so they are fully still living here. I guess my question is, if they continue to ignore us and not pay, are we legally allowed to tell them that they have to leave at the end of the month? Is it worth it given they will be leaving at the end of the year anyways?

Additionally, is there any way to negotiate working on the show as a producer, or will the PC not want to have me on with a full time position?

"As our daily cases and positive percentage continue to rise it'd be nice to have a place where we can get info on new (inevitable) restrictions and testing info.

"(Reuters) - Mental health and crisis workers in New York City will respond to emergency mental health calls instead of law enforcement under a pilot program announced on Tuesday, following months of protests around the country over police brutality.

&amp;#x200B;

The program, slated to begin in February, will be composed of new mental health teams from the Fire Department‚Äôs Emergency Medical Services unit and will target two ‚Äúhigh-need‚Äù neighborhoods, which were not identified.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFor the first time in our city‚Äôs history, health responders will be the default responders for a person in crisis, making sure those struggling with mental illness receive the help they need,‚Äù Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.

"Most of it's in the title. We're in a strongly unique position to prevent a second wave, with how easily we can get tests around the city! Make some time within your week to get tested! You can even make it a lunch date with your roommates or something.  

Hospitals are far quicker to test in all aspects than your local clinic. It's definitely worth the trip for the extra reliability, at-venue wait time, and result turnaround time. 

If you go to a clinic, chances are you'll get caught waiting as well for well/unwell visits to go by. You'll also be holding up well/unwell visits, which I have experienced - UTIs are a total bitch to wait more than half an hour with. However, no real harm done if that's your main choice. 

If you do rapid testing, my personal and unqualified recommendation is that you wear a mask afterwards anyway, given the accuracy rate is about 75%. I'd speculate it's better for knowing if you're immediately contagious. My CityMD said that I'd know within 15-20 minutes if I was tested positive, longer if negative. 

Let's snip this shit in the bud! Wear masks! Get tested! Stay socially distanced! Don't forget how god-awful the deaths were back in May. Let's do our best to look out for each other and, at least, ourselves &lt;3",0

"Hello. Sorry to bother. Also sorry if there have been recent posts about this.  

I am a NY resident, but in college out of state. I‚Äôm moving back home and my flight was intended to be later this week. I just saw the new quarantine rules, but the NYS website does not make it abundantly clear what the actual procedure is.  

So, I have to get a COVID test before I leave and I will have to show or present the results before I am allowed into NY?

"Hi 

My name is Fiona, I am a high school teacher, a wife and a mom to a toddler with special needs. I live in NYC and have my entire life. I work in a large Harlem high school. Most of my students receive free and reduced lunch, and many were severely impacted by COVID-19. 

I teach four subjects in highschool (it's a lot). The Spanish class is one of my favorites to teach, but in order to teach it correctly, you must have lots of activities for students to do together and independently to practice Spanish.   In order to help me with all of this planning, I want to buy this curriculum to support them and teach the material in a very clear and concise way. Since I teach four other classes, I find myself prepping worksheets, powerpoints and other remote materials for hours each night. This curriculum pack would lighten my load. 

I plan on buying  ""Spanish One and Two PowerPoints and Curriculum Mega Bundle"" by Angie Torre linked below:

So I am raising money to buy myself four Teachers pay Teachers gift cards of $100 

Please if you can donate just $1-5 dollars. It will help my students get the credit they need, learn the material they need to pass the exam. If you believe in leveling the playing field, and educational equity and opportunity for all, here is your chance to support our kids!

"Over the past year, I'd guesstimate that 30% of the US population suffers from different degrees of mentally illness.  
I used to think that number was much lower and only comprised of the alt-right, but I was saddened to discover that the radical left has an equal weight of mental illness.

Watching spoiled suburban young adults drop thier tiktok filming to go spit on police officers would have been comical if it wasn't so disturbing and annoying.

I lump BLM and the progressive movement into 1... Is it accurate? Maybe not, but that's how it's viewed by the world... I appreciated BLM shinning a light on the flaws of our policing practices and it's obvious to all clear headed individuals that there needs to be improvement. This is not a knock on law enforcement but it cannot be denied that law enforcement exists as a public trust and clearly this trust has been broken between them and the black community. Law enforcement has to own that.

But it's a shame that the BLM movement protests quickly morphed away from police reform and towards an anti-white American protest. So lets keep real and call it what it is.

its time for the progressives to recognize that 70 million Americans didn't vote for Trump because he represents the best and brightest or that they believe this is how a US president should behave, they voted for him b/c they rejected the movement.

The house seats that were lost and half of America voting for Trump are proof that the progressives and BLM are an anchor that will drag our party to the bottom.

To most of the US and the world the movement looked like a bunch of whiny teenagers blind to thier own hypocrisy. Fighting racism with bigotry and not seeing the irony that they were behaving worse then the deplorables they were screaming about. What was truly disgusting were the adults and the information bubbles enabling them.

I joined the democrat party long ago because to me they were the party of dignity, class, honor and as Michelle Obama said - when they go low we go high. That's what the Democratic Party is supposed to reflect. All BLM did was drag the democrat party into the gutter and proved that our progressive left can be just as disconnected and delusional as the far right.

If you watched Bill Maher on Nov 6th you saw a man named Tristin Harris try to articulate what is happening on the internet with ""information bubbles"", then in the very next segment you saw Malcolm Nance verbally throw-up the MSNBC bubble in real-time (no pun intended). He went on to say how scared he was of the Trump caravans arming themselves and likened them to the Taliban.

So delusional on so many levels, 

1. these caravans are filled with soccer moms and dentists 

2. The entire US is covered in plywood in anticipation of unrest.. But the fear wasn't that Trump would lose, they boarded-up b/c they were afraid that Trump might win!!!

Go ahead and down vote this post, and I don't expect an intelligent comment b/c I (and the world) have witnessed how easily the progressives gets triggered and that they collectively have very low emotional quotient.

That's real reality, not the shadow reality that the poisonous cable news agencies and gaslighting social media campaigns are feeding you sub conscious. I'm just afraid that our country will not be able to deprogram ourselves.. Sad.

If you like a unit- then put me down as the referring party when you submit an application. I‚Äôll come down to say hi if I‚Äôm home or we can grab a coffee!

After incentives (2-3 free months) - you can find a studio for well under $2k, or a big 1 bedroom for ~$2300 a month!! Or a 2 bedroom for under ~$3500 a month.

"This might come off as corona Cuomo vibes, but what I‚Äôm seeing in the past few weeks is not very reassuring for our future.

Halloween was pretty tame on the streets and appeared fine, but walking back from a dinner in the east village put the reality on full display.   Parties were happening across the city within apartments, some with gatherings not seen since pre covid times.   I myself was invited to several through Facebook and group chats with the invite list nearing 40 people for a tiny New York apartment for the first and 20 people for the other. 

That may seem fine for some, but when you consider the positive rate is hovering near 2%, within a group of 100 you can statistically assume that 2 people would have coronavirus.    Couple that with a mask less environment in a tiny space such as those parties and you‚Äôre setting the stage for a super spreading event.   Both parties would of had a near 50/50 chance of someone having the virus.

A similar world appeared celebrating the win of Biden.  During the day it was dancing with masks on in the streets, by nightfall dozens of indoor parties were cropping up around the city.  In East Village I walked by several large indoor parties taking place, clearly seeing packed apartments and a lack of concern.

People are losing context, being told how great New York is handling the virus and that we‚Äôre the best in the country, a country where the bar has been set incredibly low for any sort of response.   Placed into the context of parties, we‚Äôre not at a point where we can be hosting these events and expect everything to be okay.  Now is not the time to let our defenses when we see rising daily cases and the rest of the world suffering a second wave more severe than the first.  That‚Äôs how the second wave started in all of these other countries - first it was a slight increase, followed with higher case counts, and eventually things spiraled out of control and they had to lock down again.

We can work together to avoid a second lockdown and mounting deaths - just use common sense, follow health protocols like wearing a mask, and social distancing where possible.

All things said I don‚Äôt mean to set a negative tone, but I worry for our city if we don‚Äôt take more precautions.",0

"Having been born and raised in this city I have a strong preference for ""mixed minority"" neighborhoods. They are where I feel most comfortable as an Asian guy who has been labeled as deracinated and who converged to typical NYC norms growing up such as Rap music listening. 

Sociologically, mixed minority enclaves are less than 20% white and less than 50% of any other race. For example a typical mixed minority area would be the West Bronx, which is maybe 45% Black, 15% Asian, and 25% Latino, and 5% White, or many areas of Queens that are 50/50 Latino and Asian. 

According to the [Furman Center](https://furmancenter.org/research/publication/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-makeup-of-nyc-neighborhoods), mixed minority enclaves have a lower average income, college attainment, and other metrics than single minority enclaves. For example a mixed minority area typically has a lower income than Chinatown at East Broadway, Wakefield (a West Indian area) or many predominantly Latino enclaves. 

Compared to Black majority neighborhoods which have a 17% poverty rate, mixed minority neighborhoods have a 28.8% poverty rate. This doesn't relate to one's immigration status either. 66% of people in Asian majority neighborhoods are foreign born but the college achievement level there is around twice that of a mixed minority neighborhood. 

Black majority neighborhoods have an average income of 57,847, but mixed minority neighborhoods have an average income of 44,221. That's less than even I make. 

Does anyone else here, such as mixed race folk, have a preference for mixed minority enclaves? Why are they considered less equal than monoracial minority neighborhoods?",0

"I hate to be writing about this now because I know it's a wonderful, festive time in NYC and I have been very much a part of that. But this has been ongoing, so please keep that in mind.

I bought a co-op apartment in Prospect Heights in February 2020. I am a 4th-generation Brooklynite and have happily lived in this area for 8 years. I never thought I would be able to buy, but my mom died unexpectedly in 2015, which left me with enough money for a down payment for a one bedroom. I was finally making enough of a salary to be able to afford a mortgage, and it just made sense to try to invest in something for once.  


I chose a street-facing apartment because I love being able to hear the sounds of the city from my home. All of my windows face the street. Ever since the weather got nice in April, a small group of men (anywhere from 1-5) park their car directly in front of my apartment and blast music for hours on end. Right now for instance it has been eight hours. I wish it was a party due to election results, but this is a regular thing. I never know when it will start or end, or when it will happen. I never know when I will be able to watch a movie, nap, just listen to my own music, or my apartment will just be filled with their musical choices.  


I have turned to my co-op board, who wants nothing to do with it. A couple neighbors in my building have mentioned it bothers them, but it stops there. Most of the units in my building face the back of the building (including the apartment of one of the offenders. How convenient for him!).  


I posted on a neighborhood message board, but half of the response was that I should move to the suburbs and that I am ruining the neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want to change the neighborhood, there was just no way for me to know that this portion of the block is used as a street nightclub. Had I known, I would have gladly passed up this apartment and moved on with my life. They can have it! I don't want to ruin anyone's fun. But I am stuck living here. I literally cannot afford to sell this apartment ‚Äî I would lose everything (it would cost me $50-70k, I spent $12k on closing costs, and have done $5k in repairs), which just enough for a down payment for this one-bedroom apartment. I don‚Äôt have any other home, my family is mostly dead. This is my one and only home, and it‚Äôs a nightmare due to just 2-3 people.   


I have a painful health condition that I‚Äôm awaiting surgery for. I get migraines often and sometimes just need a bit of peace, to be sick, lie down, and try to relax a bit and make the pain go away. Normal city sounds are fine and help me feel more apart of this city I love so much, but this is like sitting in a concert hall. Their concert. A friend came over today and said ‚ÄúWow, I know you‚Äôve mentioned this problem and assumed you were just sensitive to noise but this is absolutely horrible, what a shame. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great place to live.‚Äù  


I have never dealt with this before here. It‚Äôs not normal city noise. All I want is to be able to have some semblance of control of the sound waves in my apartment.   


I just feel trapped. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that just a couple men could be the reason I lose all the money I ever had ‚Äî money I only got because I lost the only family and home I had ‚Äî ¬†just to get out. But I‚Äôm verging on throwing it all away just to save my sanity and not hate my life. I am 32 and on the brink of big life choices, and this could be a determining factor on whether I will have children or not. I'm stuck here financially. I would never choose to have a baby with this going on. I may eventually need brain surgery for the thing my mom died of, and I already have anxiety about how I could possibly recover and rest here after that. It‚Äôs like a party all the time. Not a place to find comfort and recover.  


Anyway, I don't know what to do. Ideas or options? I am just not a wet blanket type of person. I was out all day yelling and partying after the election results rolled in. I just need a break from the party when I'm at home.",0

"As the title states, we got our security deposit back with a $200 charge for not allowing access to our realtor. The instances in which they‚Äôre referring to were a time when I was at work, my roommate was in the shower, and someone started knocking at the door to look at the apartment. At no time were we contacted about this, they just showed up and asked to be let in. Then the broker got mad at us for just not letting her in and ‚Äúwasting his and their time‚Äù when my roommate was not even clothed or forewarned. It turned into a whole argument, when I felt it was just insane how little respect they had for us and our time. 

The other instance was when, again, I was not at the apartment and my roommate was asleep and the broker called saying he‚Äôll be there in 15 minutes. When my roommate said no one would be available until later, it became a whole issue again, then we never heard about it until we got the charge.

Now mind you, we would have loved to let anyone in to see our apartment had it actually be coordinated properly with our schedules. But both times were sprung on us out of nowhere and we just weren‚Äôt available at the time. Is this valid, are we in the wrong, or do they have validity in charging us? Is there anything we can do to fight this, because it‚Äôs just completely absurd and we were appalled to see the charges when we were such great tenants the years that we lived there.

Hello! I wanted to see how people are doing with rent negotiation. I love in a part of south Williamsburg where I‚Äôm about a 10+ min walk to anything ‚Äúgood‚Äù in bushwick/east Williamsburg or Williamsburg, though very well connected by subways (jmz+G right there, L not too far.)

I know that 2020 has been really tough on New York and a lot of other places, so I came up with an idea that encourages people to support their own city by letting you track how much you‚Äôve helped out. I made it into a major feature called Hometowns and added it to our Zonder exploration game.

You can choose a city to earn points for as you visit local attractions or businesses in the area. To add a little competitive spirit, there‚Äôs a leaderboard that shows how much support your city has gotten compared to others around the world. I'd like to challenge NYC residents to show the world how supportive you are of your city.

Just a reminder: The local economy does need our help right now, but it‚Äôs important to stay safe first. We absolutely don‚Äôt encourage risky behavior for any amount of digital points. You can earn points for going to many outdoor venues like parks and lakes, and make sure to follow all the recommended safety guidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

because we've seen a rat - but can't believe it was a rat - maybe a something else ...

&amp;#x200B;

in details?

On Saturday night \~4am we were at Park Slope, Brooklyn at 7th ave and Union St (right near - Bank of America, 92 7th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217 [https://goo.gl/maps/YaefMnxGT3C4nxBi6](https://goo.gl/maps/YaefMnxGT3C4nxBi6) )

&amp;#x200B;

an intersection we will never forget ...

and I couldn't believe my eyes ..

&amp;#x200B;

this giant - size - a bit bigger than a well grown cat 

what seemed to be like a pet pig - because it was albino/beige in color with spots 

limited white fur ...

tail was short ...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to think that it was a pig - but the way it looked, moved, like a rat ...

it went to the sewer across the street and went on further down the street ...

&amp;#x200B;

again at first - I thought it was a pet pig that ran away ... but I was shocked and petrified ...

and didn't want to provoke it ... but my girlfriend - went a bit closer to take a look ... 

&amp;#x200B;

I really regret not trying to try to take any picture of it ...

&amp;#x200B;

since I've tried to find any info on this ... but to limited extent ... thus am posting here ...

  
but we are still not sure what kind of a creature it was - but are concluding that some sort of a giant rat

&amp;#x200B;

some info that came close

"The last time I was in Manhattan was March 13. Coronavirus was at its worst. The trains were unsafe. And my job sent employees home.

All my New York friends, disappeared. Those I thought who lived in NYC, and we're wealthy based on how they live their lifestyles, silently departed New York City because they were unable to pay rent and maintain survival in the big city.

I live in Queens. But, most of my daily life is spent on Long Island. From Rockville Centre, Hewlett Harbor, Hewlett, Elmont, Woodmere, Franklin's Square, to Baldwin and Hempstead.

This was my Manhattan.

Yesterday, I grabbed my camera and went into Manhattan to capture photography of this historic time period ---- buildings boarding up on Election Day. I'm 27, I've never seen this in my time period.

To be straightforward here: This is really the most beautiful time in Manhattan. It's not too crowded and it's not too empty. Rockefeller Center is beautiful. I've never been able to capture Rockefeller Center without my photos being photo-bombed. Furthermore, as the general New Yorker when trains were red and phone boxes were a thing in NY, anytime I was in Manhattan, I did what I had to do and got out.

Now, yesterday, I was able to explore Manhattan and take in its true beauty.

For once, I was able to negotiate a hotdog for $1.50. You would never be able to do this! The guy was nice. We talked it up for about 5-minutes. He was telling me about how bad business has been lately. Then, I joked about hotdogs being $1.00.

I was able to walk in the middle of 5th avenue without fear of being hit by a vehicle. It's rare to do this in New York City! 

Oh, and the trains. Let me tell you, I've never seen subways so clean ever! It use to be a load of shit everywhere. Now, it's a masterpiece of clean beauty.

Lastly, the big red steps. I avoided the tourism hangout spot because of the crowds. But, going to the top level, New York is beautiful from a far. 

I want NYC to stay like this for a little while. I'm sure to re-visit Manhattan again before a vaccine is released. What sucked, there were no place to hangout inside. 

Deadass, I love my city. I don't plan to move from NY any time soon. Been through thick and thin. I'm sure to keep pushing through with my family by my side. All those who left NY, you're missing it's true beauty right now.",0

"Alway confirm if the price listed is ‚Äògross rent‚Äô (the actual amount you will pay every month), or if it is net effective, an average of your monthly rent FOR THE FIRST YEAR ONLY. (ex. If the LL is offering 1 month free rent on a 12 month lease of a $2000 unit, then the free month is deducted from the yearly rent, and divided by the 12 mo., giving you the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô monthly rent after savings.  

Ex. $2000 apartment with 1 mo. free on 12 mo. lease: $2000 x 11 = $22,000 / 12 = $1,833.33  This is why you‚Äôll see lots of ‚Äòbargains‚Äô in your searches.

"Summarizing their words to use for *your* convenience! I used to do this on the daily COVID-19 thread for quite a while (a few months), but I‚Äôll still do this as necessary until I don‚Äôt have any spare time, or work / other things take precedence, or the pandemic is finally gone. Hope you enjoy!  

Try to keep the conversations *only* about what Bill de Blasio and/or Andrew Cuomo said during these press conference(s). I‚Äôll keep tweaking this as we go along in the coming days, if need be.

You can find Mayor de Blasio‚Äôs press conference stream at the [NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office](https://www.youtube.com/user/NYCMayorsOffice) YouTube channel, and later on, his transcripts can be found online at the [NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news.page) website.

For Andrew Cuomo, it‚Äôs a mix sometimes where his press conferences can be found, sometimes [online](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news) on the NY Governor‚Äôs website, other times if it‚Äôs solely done by phone, some news outlets stream that too. But when it‚Äôs finished, there‚Äôs usually a [SoundCloud](https://m.soundcloud.com/nygovcuomo) upload for that too.",0
"So apparently ConEd has been unable to read my building meter for 13 months, and then back billed me for over 1K. ConEd is saying that they are installing smart meters in a week or so which may or may not change the total (could be higher or lower) and have advised me to not pay the bill until this smart meter reading comes though. 

When I said I thought it was a bit nuts that someone hadn't been able to read the meter for 13 months and I wasn't notified, they said that it was written on our bill that it was an estimate and that they needed access to the meter (in small print, last page of paper bill. I also pay online and it's not noted on the payment screen). They said they notified my landlord somehow, but admitted they didn't call him. Not sure how they apparently notified him? When I contacted my landlord, he said he had not been notified and advised me to go through the NY State Dep. of Public Service to file a claim, but that could take 2 weeks and once the bill is adjusted from the smart meter I will only have 5 days to pay. 

Just curious if anyone has had this happen to them and if there was any advice about how to handle?",0
"I‚Äôve been collecting restaurant recommendations for the past 3 months.

I have over 1000 now. Most I would‚Äôve never come across on review sites or delivery apps.

Most that would never fit the ‚Äútop 10 restaurant‚Äù criteria set by the typical review site, whatever that means.

I‚Äôve so far been sharing them on [r/nyctakeout](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyctakeout/) and [r/FoodNYC](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/).

And now I and two friends have created an [app that shows you each and every one of those recommendations](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/piky/id1534822032) (well, 500 or so of them, still adding them to the app).

You‚Äôll see great spots like Up Thai, Raku, Ho Foods, and Wah Fung No. 1 Fast Food.

I know those places, you might think. Nothing new‚Ä¶

But then there are others that you may not know about. Places like Karczma, Taiwan Pork Chop House, and Claudette (ok maybe you do know about these places - great, tell us some places that you think only you know about that we should know about!).

Point is, we all know great restaurants and think because they‚Äôre good, they must be known by others as well, right? Well, not exactly. Before this, I had no idea Little Alley sold awesome frozen dumplings. Or that you can get great fried chicken at Pelicana and BBQ Olive Chicken. Or that there's an underground restaurant called Streecha in the East Village.

tl;dr

We all know great restaurants so why not crowdsource all our recommendations onto one app?",0

"Every time we finish these god damn big 4 holidays...

Halloween
Thanksgiving
Christmas
New Years

We are super lonely throughout and after. Thus we feel like we need to invest more into relationships and family to make the lonely weather more tolerable. Then we solidify those commitments with New Years resolutions. 

Then the big emotional ass rape comes with..

Valentines Day- (Dont even get me started on the desperation and manipulation from all the interrelated parties leading up to that day.) 

Then we feel basically dead inside that whole day or usually let down by; someone else's efforts or lack thereof, their response to our efforts, or not having anyone to give or receive efforts from. After the recovery from the seasonal loneliness pain, we yet again reaffirm our commitments to this being ""my year"" even if we do so unconsciously. 


Then boom the spring blitz comes. One or two my ex loves once implied if not directly said; you can always tell the loosey gooseys by how they are always the first ones out with the super short dresses even when the weather barely, if not at all, calls for that type of attire. I disagree. I respect a woman's right to hunt. And as Dominic Toretto once said.. WINNING IS WINNING. 

Hating manipulative wifeys logic aside, we are all sprinting to get in that ""New relationship"" (even if its not the right fit) come spring. And as soon as we have something remotely intriguing we self sabotage because, and its a hard selfish fact to admit, but given the fitness and financial ambitious trends.. ever en vogue in our tri-state lives, we always gamble and risk everything we worked so hard to get, just for an inch or two of someone or something better. I sadly also fall victim to this sick cycle of chasing the highs of potential risks vs dream realities.

Then the ""New"" disappoints with more ^old bullshit and we are desperate again with summer hunting season over to grab whatever is left on the shelves, right around august and september, just to avoid those same damn lonely up coming holidays. Even though we know we are gonna be arguing throughout with our risky short term investments, especially when we see it coming, because even if the people we have, are who think we want, we dont actually want them. We hate who we have to be to sustain them. And I am sure they hate the fake faces they wear as well to sustain us. Relationships turn into jobs, and I am sure we are good at our careers. But a lot of us cant keep a decent job past 2 yrs, 6 months, and some times after that 2 week cash in. Lol. Like staying too long just for the ""benefits"" aint worth it. 

I had a good and rough 2018

2019 was bullshit

Oddly 2020 is a wild card. 

But 2021 feels like the same damn pattern creeping up on me and happening again. 

I have learned that yes, you have to be confortable alone, which I am. But damn nigga I like pussy and I aint got one being alone. And professional sex workers are solid. But ""oh baby, I like raw"". 

Porn keeps the shitbag side of myself at bay but only for so long. And its like penny wise but dollar foolish with regards to actual life experiences against viewing porn, cause when that shit balances out later it costs you more in life. You're older doin crazy things that you shouldve done when you were Young but you kept watching porn. Now either she doesnt live up to your expectations or your mad at your self because you think you arent living up to hers expectations and oddly blame her. Porn logic is very often flawed. With each new vag u get it slips right through your fingers no matter how much trump.. grab em by it macheezmo you put forth.

For me: 

Sure a lot of them want to stick around but after a while I dont like who they are and more importantly I dont like who I am with them. So yet again as I change, I reach for another platea, all while chasing the ever elusive stability and permanence of someone growing with me in the same direction without her always having to be New~ 
~Ideally she ""Just Is"" and thats more than enough. 

Now Im in my mid 30s. Two women of my children, both successful in their own right. But both are nonoptions for various reasons. To the point that I have to make myself a nonoption to them. As such I consciously try not to focus on being overly successful to avoid relationships with them and others because some chicks are like vipers when they see the coins. Its like they can smell it on you even if you try to hide it or atleast dont boast. Simult√°neamente its hell of a thing to ask a mind to comprehend that if she makes way way more than you, and if you definitively paid for her to have that position, that you still gotta make punishment payments cause she cant stand to see you happy.. even if you alone nigga, she still wanna see you suffer. I mean dont even get me started on the seconds one. I mean why I gotta pay the home rent, office rent, and buy Christmas toys in october... But im not allowed to talk about money because im throwing it in her face. Nigga look at my fuckin Bank accounts. Bruised as fuck aint the words. My accounts got gangbanged and for some reason it doesnt feel consentual.

"When cold weather comes, quality goes down, especially for fruit, but vegs too. I live on the UWS, and can't afford to pay ripoff prices or throw inedible stuff away. Any suggestion of places that have good produce during the winter?

Vegs is easier but still - I got a cabbage to make autumn cole-slaw from my local market and it was bitter. A waste. 

I don't want to overpay, but there must be somewhere around these parts where they make an effort to get stuff (esp fruit, which is harder during the winter) that is good and doesn't wind up getting thrown away b/c it's inedible.

"Thinking about starting up a business, wanted some feedback. I'm based in New York and work in the apparel industry. I want to create a website that allows users to:
1. Get basic tshirts hoodies sweatshirt blanks with the option to get custom labels and prints of their own and package it for them. (Basically kickstart a brand and give products ready for them to ship to their customers). 
2. Allow bigger brands to outsource their production by placing larger orders overseas.
3. A marketplace where people can post their designs and we will print them when ordered and split ƒ∫
profits with the designer. 

Would love some honest feedback!!!

"**What to do at home**

Step 1: [Find your polling location](https://findmypollsite.vote.nyc/). You must vote at the correct polling location. At the site I linked, the location will be in red. (The blue one is the early voting location)

Step 2: Bring your Fast Pass if you have one. They are plastic cards with barcodes on them that many people got in the mail. They also contain your ED/AD number. If you don't have one, just write down your ED/AD number from the above site. It's on the line ""Election/Assembly District"".

Step 3: Bring your ID. But do not hand it to a poll worker unless asked.

Step 4: Do not wear any political attire, such as shirts or hats that have a candidate's name on them. You may get turned away if you wear something like that.

**What to do when you get there**

SKIP THE INFORMATION TABLE LINE. The information table only looks up your ED/AD number, which you already have from the steps above. The check-in tables will be labelled with an ED/AD number and will have their own lines. Jump right on!

Once you are inside, have your fast pass ready if you have one. If not, they will just need your name and address. Do not hand over your ID unless they ask!

**More pro tips**

Do not take pictures inside! It's against the law to take a picture inside a polling location.

If you are on the end of the line when polls close, you will vote. Even if you're not in the building yet. They process the entire line. They just won't let *more* people onto the end of the line once polls close.

If you have a disability (like if you rely on a cane or wheelchair) you can skip all the lines. Just go right on in. Same applies if you have an injury, like if your foot is in a boot.

If you have an absentee ballot, skip all the lines. There should be a box right inside and you can just drop it off. Make sure it's sealed and signed (just follow all the instructions carefully). It does not need postage if you're dropping it at a poll site.

**Questions?**

Hope these are helpful, and see you at the polls! I'll be here tonight and tomorrow to answer as many questions as I can. A few questions came up in my [early voting thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jhjpnn/i_am_an_nyc_poll_worker_here_are_the_top_things_i/) so you could also check that out.",0
"Has anyone noticed an increase in people on the subway who just outright refuse to wear a mask? I feel like in the last month or so it has gotten much worse.

I‚Äôm not talking about people wearing it as a chin strap or wearing it below the nose. I‚Äôm talking about people with no mask to be seen. I‚Äôm also not talking about people who do not wear it on the platform, I‚Äôm talking about on the actual subway car. Whether you think masks work or not, it just feels like the right thing to do when we‚Äôre all jammed together in a subway car.

I‚Äôve even seen people who wear their mask on the platform and then TAKE IT OFF once they get on the subway. It drives me nuts.

"So my landlord sucks (what else is new in NYC), and I realized the first winter in my new apartment that the windows are basically useless in terms of preventing heat loss.  The condensation on the inside of the window creates so much water that it pools on the sheetrock windowsill

Ultimately, the windows should be replaced and the exterior wall reinsulated (it's definitely not insulated)

"today i was at the farmers market, trailing ish behind an older lady with a very sweet dog. i had seen her at the start of the market saying ""happy halloween you WITCH"" it what seemed like an unpleasant tone. i finally caught up with her mid-market, and saw her turn around and yell ""piss on you"" - i was thinking she was kind of crazy, but, since I work at the market was curious as to what happened.

we finally were on line at the same stand, and her dog jumped on me. i said how sweet the pup was, and the woman nearly broke down. her dog let a little pee out near both stands, and the owners became very upset. i understand both sides, but it's an outdoor market where dogs are allowed.

she told me it had been her first time out in four months off her street, and she felt that every scolding had been a personal attack. that she would have gone home and felt badly and ashamed for hours. 

the truth is, the guy who yelled at her is known to be a mega asshole, and he just decided to pick on her that day- she would have never known that, and he would have never known her anxiety in being outside as a 70 year old single woman. 

it just reminded me to be more patient and remember that even in frustrating moments, just take one step back and try to understand where a person is coming from.

Hi r/NYC,

I made it back to the city for the first time since last year.  I had a very nice visit, not as intense as last year but still very immersive. 

Pictures: [https://www.flickr.com/gp/158149703@N04/0032XG](https://www.flickr.com/gp/158149703@N04/0032XG) 

Stepping out of Port Authority certainly felt different. Compared to the last time I set foot in the city it was desolate  especially for Friday night. There should have been flocks of people heading to shows, bars and getting ready to take on the night. Times Square while still not completely empty had a notably dark and gritty feel, something I have not in my lifetime experienced. Looking out of the New Yorker Hotel onto the skyline I pondered, was it too early to come back? 

My trip turned out amazing. I went to the furthest northern reaches of Manhattan for the first time and then all the way down to the beaches by Coney Island. I made my initial exploration of the vast and varied corridors of the Met. I went down to the brand new Pier 26 and took in the stunning views along the Brooklyn Height Promenade. I went out at night to the Upper East Side and down in Greenwich Village. 

New York City even in a pandemic surpasses any other city  in normal times. It is amazing just how many people are out in the streets going about their day. The city attracts people from all around the world, each and everyone so much focused on a purpose and mission. There is nothing so satisfying as to go for a walk and take in the vibrant streets and interesting points of view.

I absolutely love getting a feel for a city and what local life is all about. The NYC I experienced was for the most part a local experience, no dazed tourists or photo obsessed influencers to break the immersion. It was sad to see Broadway shuttered and no live performances to see. However the dancing nature of the city is still kept alive by the street performers and outdoor patio players. I even listened to a cellist playing in a cozy corner in Central Park. 

I‚Äôm glad I made it out to the city and will definitely return soon. I can‚Äôt wait to explore more neighborhoods, see more museums and continue to get a better feeling of each borough.  ‚ÄúAs for New York City, it is a place apart. There is not its match in any other country in the world.‚Äù - Pearl S. Buck

"I‚Äôve been trying to get any response about this from the BOE for days, and since I‚Äôm genuinely absentee (as in not living at the address where I‚Äôm registered at the moment) I thought I‚Äôd try here before trekking back to Queens to vote Tuesday. 

According to the tracker, my ballot was received on 10/20, and the status at the top of the page reads Ballot Received. However I‚Äôve seen pictures of other people‚Äôs tracking where the top of the page reads Ballot Received Valid. Now, Ballot Received Valid does appear in my Tracking History, but it‚Äôs earlier than the current ballot status of Ballot Received. 

Does this mean some issue was found with my ballot and it‚Äôs now in dispute? Obviously I‚Äôm worried that it was marked valid and then validity was rescinded. Could also just be a weird glitch and nothing to worry about! It would be nice if the BOE could return an email or if their phone system wasn‚Äôt a useless automated series of circular menus, but here we are. Fortunately I‚Äôm just in a different borough, so I won‚Äôt be disenfranchised by quarantine restrictions if I need to make an 11th hour return to vote. But still, the ease with which this confusion could be avoided (any kind of reply from the BOE, a FAQ detailing the various ballot statuses) is mind boggling. 

Thanks for any insight, Reddit!",0
"Hi there,
Hope you all are well and safe.

I was living in the city before lockdown, but then decided to stay with few hours away in a different state which is unfortunately on the travel advisory list. I am going to come back soon because I have an exam scheduled and will also be looking to move out of my place around the same time. I was considering quarantining for 14 days but saw Cuomo recently changed the rules to testing before and after travel. 

I was wondering if anybody who recently traveled can advise what is the better option, both in terms of safety and precautions. 

- How easy is it to get a covid test in NYC? Is there any risk in terms of being exposed when surrounded by people coming to get a test? And if I come to NYC on a Saturday and need to go somewhere on the following Saturday but take the Covid test on a Wednesday or Thursday of the week, will that be enough time to get the results? 

- Anybody do the 14 day quarantine? Any tips for adequately preparing to stay indoors most of the time? I guess I‚Äôll be stocking up on food and hand wash clothes for now since we don‚Äôt have indoor laundry unit lol. 

- How is everything in terms of safely traveling, public transportation wise and all. It seems quite safe as far as I see, but I have hardly left to go anywhere in these past few months and want to make sure I take all the precautions possible

Thanks!!",0

"After living in an apartment for a year, we left and my landlord refuses to give us back the deposit. His argument is ""there are new cracks on the wall tiles and floor"". We did not cause this, this was based on wear and tear. The apt had no heat the first 2 months and was caused by thermal expansion. He refuses to believe this and thinks we purposely cracked the floors and walls. 

I put in a case on Turbo Court so I can take the landlord to small claims court. After 2 weeks, I still have not received any updates. I called the small claims court and they said it is closed until next year. This is very frustrating as we could really use the $1,700 our landlord is holding from us. 

Is there any word on a possible reopening date for small claims court?",0

"A week ago I was the happiest guy alive...today, I'm at one of the deepest lows of my life. I met someone on Craigslist who was renting a 3br apartment. According to the guy (lets call him the Craigslist contact), he is the leaseholder who lived there for years but decided to move out, and sublet the rooms.    After checking out the apartment and meeting the current tenants (not the guy I've been talking to), I paid  1mo rent + 1mo security (via Zelle) for November to the craiglist contact.   I moved in a few days ago, and it has been a nightmare since.   

The day after I moved in, the two other roommates told me they decided to move and would be out within a few days.  To make things worse, a day later, the power goes out.    According to the guy on the lease, he's been paying utilities. According to the building's super, ""everything looks ok in the basement."" Supposedly an electrician was sent to fix the issue, but the power is still out three days later. 

To top it all off, I just got a call from the building's owner/landlord, and found out that my craigslist contact hasn't paid rent for 14 months, and is currently getting sued for it.  He was surprised to hear the apartment had a new tenant but was pretty clear that he's been getting screwed and that I got myself into a big mess.    He suggested that I move out ASAP and try to get my money back,, but I have a feeling that will be difficult/impossible.   The landlord said that he expects the City Marshalls to come anytime and bolt up the apartment.  I know there is a hold on evictions right now, but I'm not sure if this situation qualifies for protection, considering how long this situation has been going on. I really also cant live at this place anymore without power.  

Does anyone have advice on how I should go about getting my money back? Today is the 1st, so I must contact the craiglist connect today to make things clear that I intend to leave ASAP.   I figure that I may need to pursue a civil suit, but I am generally less than optimistic with the legal system. I am currently looking at new places to move, but I'm just frustrated that I may have lost a lot of money.. Any advice or encouragement would be super welcome. Thanks :)",0

The gist: 

* For travelers who were in another state for¬†more than 24 hours:
   * Travelers must obtain a test within three days of departure from that state.
   * The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.
   * On day 4 of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain seek another COVID test. If both tests come back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.

Can someone shed some light on this matter? I'm supposed to travel roundtrip from NYC to Los Angeles this weekend. I will leave on Friday evening and return on Sunday morning (total trip is about 36 hours). I won't have time on Saturday to get tested in LA. If I get tested on Thursday or Friday in NYC, will that be okay to let me back into NYC on Sunday? Like, as far as the ""you need to test negative before arriving in NYC"" part of this goes - who is enforcing this? Will it be the airline before I board my flight that confirms I was tested? Or is it enforced once I arrive in NYC? 

i want to make it clear I am absolutely down to get a test before I fly back into NYC i just hope they will accept one that was done in NYC prior to traveling to another state

"Posting to receive some different perspectives. Please hold of on all comments that contain hyperbolic doomsday news such as ‚ÄúReal estate will crash in 2021 or 45% of New Yorkers are moving out to Florida‚Äù
I‚Äôve already read all those headlines.

Background, I‚Äôve lived in New York for almost 10 years and for 8 of those years, have always been looking at real estate. At some point, I considered even getting a license to do it part-time, as it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm passionate about. So for what it‚Äôs worth, I do believe I have a good pulse on prices.

My savings didn‚Äôt really grow exponentially until joining Google, for obvious reasons. I‚Äôm talking about networth from $100k to $800k in four years (including retirement). Most of it is with stock appreciation and also single picks that played out well in the past few years. I can write a post on this if people are interested.

I‚Äôve always mentally had a down payment number of when I‚Äôd feel ready to buy a home, however kept waiting and waiting as my stock portfolio grew, and didn‚Äôt make sense to purchase $1M+ 1beds next to the google office.

Given where we are today, prices have cooled and I finally feel ready to buy, as I have more than enough in assets for a 15-20% down.

Recently I have put an offer in for an almost new 2bd/2ba in the heart of Brooklyn for around $1.2M, low monthlies around $550 taxes and HOA. 13 yr tax abatement left. Mortage lending for 10/1 arm is around 2.5% @15% down or 2.375@ 20% down. 30 year fixed is 2.75% as this is jumbo loan.

Here is the kicker.

I actually want to move to California in a year. Why? Better weather and outdoor space. Where? Maybe LA, but open to Bay. I mention this because, given the obvious this apartment is in New York.

My rationale of buying is two fold:

1) I always want a place in New York to call home or to visit. And this place is absolutely beautiful.

2) I want to play the appreciation game. This place has a cap rate of 4%, and even in today‚Äôs COVID market I can rent out at break even of mortage. Post COVID, there‚Äôs possibility for a $1500/mo spread. If market can appreciate to $1.5M in 5 years, given the cash flow and interest deduction, I can net about $350k given assumption of $5k rent for 2b/2ba.

That‚Äôs about 140% return on investment. 

*3) a third is diversification strategy. I‚Äôm 90% invested in the market, and find RE to be a bit more less volatile.

Another detail, today I have really cheap rent in a lottery building. Paying around $2200 for a luxury 1bd. I could rent this out or if I don‚Äôt buy - eat the cost every month I don‚Äôt live there BUT have the flexibility to move around whenever as it‚Äôs not that big of an expense.

My question to you all who have bought or in the process: what‚Äôs your experience so far with owning condos and the overhead?

Is out of state / opposite coast tenant management reasonable?

Should I keep money in the market and just buy in California?

Hedge half in ZM in case COVID never ends? ;) kidding of course.

TLDR; Want to buy property in NY. However plan to move to Cali. Have the money, but should I pull the trigger?

"Hey all, I have some general questions about the current state of nyc. I‚Äôm from Fairfield county (CT) and ended up in Charlotte, NC after college. It‚Äôs a nice enough city but I always wanted to end up back in the northeast since my family is still in CT. I never thought I could afford it comfortably, until the past couple years where I got my career figured out. 

So, people are fleeing the city because of the pandemic but it seems like a great opportunity to get established there more easily due to the rent prices coming down and my current work situation (remote).

I make about $100-110k and I want to convince my company to let me keep working remotely for now, which is highly likely since my boss is already 100% remote. Then the plan would be to move up there around spring time. I own a condo and I could sell it pretty quickly, no lease to break or anything. Here are some questions I have for you all, I know a lot is up in the air but just trying to get a sense of how New Yorkers feel. 

1. There are a bunch of 700-800 square foot apartments in neighborhoods like the upper east side for $2500 a month or less. If I sign a year lease, do you think the rent prices are going to jump right back to where they were pre-covid, or will it be more gradual? What are my rights as a renter in a market priced unit (if any)?

2. Am I being too optimistic about the future state of the city? I‚Äôm assuming restrictions will get bad again in the winter and loosen up in the spring, and that in the long term, nyc will always be nyc. 

3. Any general advice for moving during the pandemic?

4. Are there any areas of manhattan I should avoid living in? I was looking into mostly the upper east side, lower east side, or east village. 

I heard diblasio is reducing nypd funding by a significant amount so I‚Äôm curious how that‚Äôs playing out too.",0

"Long story short, moved into a building in Bushwick which wasn't ready to be lived in (no hot water for 3 weeks, no internet for a month) and the landlord became only less helpful. When covid hit I left. Come the last month of the lease I reached out about security deposits and he said within a month of the lease ending. 

.

Well....

 .  
  
A month came and went and I'll let you guess what happened. He kept it. I reached out and when I let slip I knew my tenant rights and I wasn't in NYC anymore he went silent. I called, emailed, texted, and even sent a letter of demand and it was nothing. I fill out a form for rent security complaints on the NYC Bureau of Consumer Frauds and Protections, and let him know I'll be mailing it tonight. FIVE FUCKING MINUTES LATER, he says it will be sent this week.",0

"Hey, a bit troubled here because my partner and I recently moved into a 1bdrm in June and we just got hit with a whopping 745$ bill because they are charging us all at once the 119 days since we moved in. We have paid apparently only their estimated guess to our electricity usage, since no one had come in to read the meter until last week. The first recorded number is from June 22 and it reads 42830. The next number recorded is 46241 on Oct 19. We had 2 acs, but one was off 95% of the time unless it was extremely hot and the bedroom ac was on energy saver, even if left overnight. 

My partner and I are both unemployed at the moment since our jobs are not open due to Covid, and we're running through our savings because of the lack of the extra funds from the weekly unemployment. I understand because we're home all the time that our electricity bill usage is well high, however is there anything we could say to the customer service representative to either split the bill or have it lowered? The bill was originally almost 1k but they deducated what we've already paid these past few months.",0
"I hate moving and enjoy my apartment, however, rents have fallen quite a bit and I can‚Äôt imagine renewing at my current price. Same floor plan as mine is listed $500 less across the street. My lease is up for renewal in 4 months. 

Each year here they‚Äôve always increased. Last renewal the tried to increase by $125/mo and I think we got them down to $75, which still wasn‚Äôt great but at least we set a tone of negotiating. That last renewal was in March right as Covid hit, so the timing wasn‚Äôt great for me. We‚Äôve never missed rent, always paid on time, tip the super, quiet, clean, etc. 

Any advice on timing or approach? I was thinking of contacting the broker we used a few years ago to get in here, just to see if maybe I can pay him a few hundred dollars and have him get it down. He‚Äôs tight with the owners here and they are exclusive with him.

"While exploring New York City in the 3 years I've lived here, I've found myself ordering my favorite sandwich in delis all over New York. The local deli's are pretty good, but being in Greenwich Village they're quite pricey (6 bucks)

My favorite place I've been to was in Brooklyn, On the corner of Meeker Ave and Union Ave, across the street from Mt Carmel Triangle. From the 3 times I've ordered Bacon Egg &amp; Cheeses there, they've all been fantastic. The cheese is melted to the perfect level, and the egg is actually soft and melty like the cheese itself. Portions have been more than usual, all the while being half the price of what I was use to. At the price of 3 dollars, you really can't beat that anywhere.

"It seems extremely odd that NY hasn't already legalized recreational marijuana. I understand Cuomo used to be against both medical and recreational marijuana, but he has since switched his stances on both medical and recreational. Along with the fact that many states around NY are legalizing recreational and drastically improving their medical when compared to NY's, which hasn't really improved at all since 2018. NY is already losing many people who are buying their products, both medical and recreational products, outside NY. Not to mention that NJ is bound to legalize recreationally, which is literally like a 30 min or less drive from NYC.

Cuomo says he is currently looking to legalize recreational use in 2021, however if he is true to his word (he isn't), that means at the very least it will take until 2022 until it is rolled out. Just all seems like a joke and the lawmakers, along with Cuomo, are figuring out how to make the most money from this, which is a joke considering they are losing money right now if you think about all the people buying out of state. What is stopping all the assembly men from writing legislature legalizing recreational marijuana today?

He smokes cigarettes on the fire escape and is still having people over. I'm in my mid 30s and really don't want to deal with this. I'm also not a jerk. I'm cool with people having people over. And I know it's NYC. But he's been a lot. 

I resigned my lease a month ago and he moved in a week ago. Tossing that out there.

Can anyone offer up any advice on how to deal with this situation? I love my apartment, but would leave it in a heartbeat to get out of this situation. Not sure if I can since I'm tied to my lease. I'm sure people will tell me to go speak to him. I actually have and so has the building owner (as I mentioned earlier). He's a kid who wants to party. So I think all convos have and will fall on deaf ears.

I appreciate any advice anyone can offer.",0

"I'm at a loss of words.  


After following their instructions every step of the way, I learn today that the DMV has lost my official Vehicle Title and other documents after using their ""Secure"" lockbox system.  


I purchased a vehicle with an out of state title which was signed off to me and I gathered that document along with all other DMV requests such as a notarized bill of sale and contacted the DMV for the safest way to get this processed. I was instructed to drop it off at a secure lock box of which I did and waited patiently 6 weeks.  


I have probably called in 5 times with 2 hour holds only to be told to wait for a call back which I never received. I did not receive any confirmation regarding receipt of my documents and today I had enough and went to the DMV in person.  


They are not seeing anyone without an appointment which you can only get for unrelated issues but a nice security guard did check my ID and reported back to me that they have no record of ever receiving my documents which were dropped off 6 weeks ago in addition to mentioning I am not the only who experienced this.  


There is no accountability and of course there is nothing they can do, I don't understand how they allow sensitive documents to be processed this way and they only want originals. I remember my gut feeling of uneasiness when I was dropping the docs off to their lockbox.  


What can I do in this situation? I was trying to get my vehicle registered in my name. Because the registration was not processed, the official title signed off to me was lost along with the notarized bill of sale.. What can I do now?",0

"So don't sure if this is the best place to post this but like a lot of people, me and my husband are reevaluating things because of the pandemic. Just some background on us: We're nearing our forties and childfree. We work in tech. I'm hispanic and he's from the UK. We're no strangers to big cities and like the amenities of them; diversity, good food and arts. We've lived in LA, London and now NYC. Out of all those places, LA was my favorite because the food, events, and access to mountains and beaches. London I liked the least because of the weather, hard to get things done and more soulless than the other two. 

We like NYC but as we get older, it's been harder to meet people our age. However, we've been here only three years. We want to buy a place but it's pretty much impossible here and of course, it's super expensive and right now we can't enjoy any of what we are paying for. The apartment feels smaller of course, and we feel like we're just seeing the difficulties of a big city and not the benefits. 

At the same time, we aren't sure we can live in a small town or any place that doesnt have the things a big city offers. Anyone sort of in the same boat or have any suggestions of where New Yorkers might be happy without the cost?",0

Cause their web-site still states Oct 9. Either way seems pretty shitty way of conducting business. Shouldn‚Äôt they say it‚Äôs an option if that‚Äôs an option?

" Hey guys, was just slaving away at my office job when I came up with the fantasy of running my own clothing store here in NYC and curious how viable ya'll think it is. I buy almost all of my clothes from online websites, the type that show you ads on insta or whatever, and I'm usually pretty frustrated by the fact that there's no physical stores that sell that type of avant garde/edgy/meme clothes at a decent price point in person (e.g. [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0021/5629/8301/products/fd03b530f5196e40c3fe7767e270a04c\_590x.jpg?v=1582270422](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0021/5629/8301/products/fd03b530f5196e40c3fe7767e270a04c_590x.jpg?v=1582270422) which I just bought).

So what if I struck up a deal with some of those online meme retailers from aliexpress to purchase $10,000 of merch at a decent discount, opened up a physical store, and started selling them at a decent markup? It would still be cheaper than most ""fashionable"" clothes in NYC. Rent would be painful but things are pretty cheap due to covid (sadly) pushing people out. My napkin math tells me I'd need to sell around $1500 of clothes a day to be pretty successful.

"The number of online Trump enablers who seem to relish in the suffering of metro areas perplex me. The fact that elected officials with statistics in hand echoe their nonsense is even more confusing

Do they know that [blue districts make up around two thirds of the US economy?](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/). 

Do they know that NYC itself contributes around [8% of this country's GDP?](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/11-mind-blowing-facts-about-new-yorks-economy-2019-4-1028134328#) Some people are drunk on making cities pay for the crime of dominating America's cultural sphere and presenting a conception of the country that they don't like. They are literally cheering for the demise of their own country. It's even more confusing when you get people living in these very metro areas (like my brother) cheering along with them. Like bro **you live in a fucking blue district***! What are you cheering with these people for

We already know that Senate Republicans don't want to help states [with their budget loss](https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/07/republican-coronavirus-stimulus-proposal-includes-no-new-funding-for-state-and-local-governments-democrats-sought-875-billion.html) if said states have ""spending that they view as wasteful"". Regardless of how you feel about this idea of wasteful spending (and God does the fucking MTA need to get its shit fixed), forcing states to restructure themselves in the middle of the pandemic while not providing an adequate safety net is not the way to go. If you're gonna tell states to full spending, you have to provide a viable alternative for all the people with legitimate problems who will be cut out. But let's be fucking real here, the only thing the Republican party can agree on is cutting taxes, anti-abortion laws and LGBTQ-bshing. Anything that involves coming up with something original, it fails. That's why they couldn't even agree with a replacement healthcare plan that doesn't screw over people with pre-existing conditions, Trump's ""infrastructure week"" (he's been saying that shit for 4 years now), immigration reform, a actual solution for the housing crisis and even their climate change plan was made by a small chunk of the party rather than all of them coming together to ash it out. The GOP can only say no. 

I don't care if Trump or even Biden wins at this point. While we were all locked down,  seeing trailers filled with dead bodies, watching doctors and nurses plead for more equipment, hearing from friends or family members that they'd lost someone, I saw another side of the country cheer and jeer, politicians play favorites with essential supplies. This shit ain't going with Trump. If we are going to be seen as undeserving citizens of a crime-riden anarchist shithole, then let's not taint our moral superiors with our dirty money and keep it to ourselves.

"I have been looking at condos online for a while now, I kind of enjoy it!  I've viewed a few in the past, but never got a realtor as we were a bit indecisive.

I had a realtor to buy a house 10 years ago (not in NY) and used the same one to sell same house 2 years ago.  It worked fine, but that was a $200k house and I was living in NYC, so I didn't mind paying the commissions.   Now I'm looking to spend $700k-1M and the 3% commission on both sides that the seller pays seems crazy when it could be $50k.

"President Trump‚Äôs  allies have promoted claims of corruption aimed at the former vice  president‚Äôs son in an effort to damage the Biden campaign.

President  Trump‚Äôs allies have long promoted claims of corruption about Joseph R.  Biden Jr.‚Äôs son Hunter in a bid to damage Mr. Biden‚Äôs presidential  campaign. The accusations intensified in recent days when some of Mr.  Trump‚Äôs associates, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani,  provided material for a New York Post article  detailing some of the allegations. The Post reported that the F.B.I.  had seized a computer that purportedly belonged to Hunter Biden.

The  Biden campaign has rejected the accusations. Many questions remain  about the origins of the allegations themselves, the laptop and what, if  anything, agents are investigating.

## What are the allegations Mr. Trump and his allies are making?

The  Post article relied on documents purportedly taken from the computer to  try to buttress an unsubstantiated argument peddled by Mr. Giuliani and  other Trump supporters: that as vice president, Mr. Biden had shaped  American foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit his son. The events are  the latest chapter in a more than two-year effort by the president and  his allies to uncover damning information about the Bidens, a pursuit  that also helped prompt Mr. Trump‚Äôs impeachment.

Mr.  Biden has long said he knew nothing about his son‚Äôs business activities  in Ukraine. But the article suggested that the former vice president  met with an adviser to a Ukrainian energy company whose board Hunter  Biden sat on, Burisma Holdings. The article referred to an email that  the adviser, Vadym Pozharskyi, sent to Hunter Biden thanking him for  ‚Äúgiving an opportunity to meet your father‚Äù and to spend ‚Äúsome time  together.‚Äù [UFC 254 Live Stream](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFC254tvs/)

 A Biden campaign spokesman said Mr. Biden‚Äôs official schedules did not  show a meeting between the two men. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George  Mesires, told The Washington Post that ‚Äúthis purported meeting never happened.‚Äù",0

"I worked Early Voting today.  


At my site, we were told to show up 2 hours before hand to make sure EVERYTHING was set up correctly.  On a normal election day, showing up an hour is enough time to prep and get ready.  


At my site, the line wrapped around the block 1 1/2 times.  For most part it was orderly, and the longest wait it took was 2 hours.   The smart ones brought their own folding or lawn chairs.  Some were already in line when I got to the site at 8 AM.  


If you're dropping off absentee ballots, you can bring them to the Information Desk and drop them off.  You don't have to wait in line.  If you want to vote in person, you have to wait on the line.  Depending on your site, priority is given to handicap and elderly.  You have to let the poll worker at the door know.

  
Some tips for voting.  
If you have a chair, I would bring a chair.   
On your ballot, only fill in one oval per line.  If you fill in too many oval, say every time you see your candidate's name, the scanner will flag it.  You then have a choice of returning the ballot, or continuing to cast it.  If you cast it, I was told the outcome will be a 'null' ballot.

You can take your ballot back, and ask to receive new one.  Please do not throw away your ballot.  As poll workers, EVERY ballot has to be accounted for.  The numbers reported from the Scanners, affidavits and ballots given out have to match up.  We can not leave until this is reconciled.  


Please don't walk away until you get confirmation from the scanner that your vote is cast.   
Some of think there is active voter suppression.  I do know NYC Board of Elections increased the number of Early Voting sites from 60 for the June Primary to almost 90 for this election cycle.  As a poll worker, I did not see any active attempt at voter suppression.  You may have a poll worker who gave out incorrect information, that's likely due to poor training.  Everything we do is done in a bi-partisan team of two, and sometimes with a police officer.  Especially if it involves unjamming a scanner, or opening it.  
Taking photos inside the poll site.  
There is no picture taking inside the poll site.  This is BOE's policy.  The only exception is for the press.  Please don't hate me, I don't make the rules, just enforce them for everyone.",0

March in support of music workers, preserve our culture 

Live music is a cornerstone of NYC culture. Right now there is no plan for live music. Government officials have prevented musicians from playing, even as venues are opening and taking customers. Music advertisements were banned by SLA. 1099 gig workers are in danger of losing unemployment benefits. Grants are few. Digital music is undervalued. No Broadway, no symphony, no cruise ships, no wedding bands. No TOURS! Even selling merch is difficult now. 

Musicians are hurting, many having to leave the city where they built their lives and careers, in pursuit of work elsewhere. 

Marching for musicians is also marching for venues, box office workers, security staff, production crews, sound engineers, managers, road managers, bookers, arts administrators, club managers, servers &amp; bartenders... the list goes on... Live music is the lifeblood of a whole ecosystem of jobs, and the foundation for a priceless culture that enriches our lives day to day. 

We need a path forward for this industry and the multitudes of people involved.",0

"I've just gone through a housing search and dodged a bullet thanks to [whoownswhat.justfix.nyc](http://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc)

They index not just the owner and manager of every building in NYC, but they also provide information on what other buildings they own and also provide a breakdown of how many open HPD violations they across all of their buildings. From what I can tell, not a lot of folks know about this site, so thought I'd pass along the word to anybody else doing a housing search.

I nearly moved into 13 Essex in Chinatown/LES recently and after a few things set off my sketch-radar, I  looked them up on justfix. Their record was abysmal.

"Choices that my parents made as 1st generation Asian immigrants by taking out loans and sacrificing:  


""Don't talk to strangers and go read books while I shop."" I remember when I was in my early teens, in the summer, my mom would drop me off at Barnes and Noble or any local public library and make me do SAT prep or do work books on a separate notebook for 4-12 hours. I would be there from 10am to 11pm sometimes. This allowed my mom to save money from babysitting and use it to increase our education.

I remember when I was in grade school, we went to Korean/Christian school on Saturday and Church on Sunday. The school part was some classes but it was primarily a babysitting service for kids. We also participated in Kumon during gradeschool, which is an Asian business that provides extra math and english worksheets to complete to solidify math and english skills.

In highschool, we were also sent to Korean Saturday schools that hired regular teachers to teach more english and math. My mom signed me up to a Kaplan's SAT course and another private SAT prep course class run by Koreans. My mom also hired us an SAT prep teacher and tutors. I remember in highschool, she looked around in many towns to look for free tutors. When she found it, she drove us back and forth for free tutoring. I remember this also happening in public libraries. There were programs where college students and seniors in highschool tutored 7-8th graders. My schedule in highschool was school, do hw, eat dinner, study until sleep at 11pm.

My parents also paid for multiple instrument lessons, including violin and piano for the both of us, then band instruments for the both of us. My mom played the piano at church and taught piano privately to pay for most of these things. So much of our parents' income was used to make us better and they went into a lot of debt at times to give us these opportunities. They sacrificed their fun and their hobbies for us to have more. One of the biggest sacrifices they made was instead of buying a house in a lower middle class neighborhood that we lived in, according to our means, my mom basically forced my dad to move to a better neighborhood that he couldn't afford so that we could get a better education. We moved to an upper middle class whose houses ranged from 400k to 1.4 million in 2004. Instead of paying mortgage in a more affordable area, they decided to rent in an upper middle class purely for our education. The public highschool we attended was top 30 in our state.

I would argue that a certain percentage of Koreans study 4-40 hours (average is 4-7 hours probably, but I was forced to study for 20-40 hours a week in highschool after school) a week more on average than most Americans. This is the to me one of the biggest factors. The ironic thing is, the amount Korean-Americans study is still not as much as Koreans and Japanese do in their countries on average. In south Korea, it isn't uncommon for lower class parents to work extra to pay for extra tutoring or extra classes at private businesses for their kid's future.

I think all these values allow Asians to do well in whatever they do. Of course not every family is like this, as Koreans whose families have been here for many generations seem to liberalize and Americanize, but this is why children of Asian immigrants do so well. Also every culture is different in different ways in Asia. And I've also noticed in every country, there's responsible culture and irresponsible culture- 2 different ways of living. The type of Koreans who immigrate to the US also happen to be Christian. I don't know if you've seen the Office but they make fun of this with the Korean van that picks up Koreans from parts of Scranton to bring to the church. We had this in our area where I grew up too.

Also Koreans and I think Haitians have started their own radio stations in certain areas like NY/NJ. They translate local and national American news to Korean. This serves as a information network, which along with parents gossiping helps a lot of useful information to spread quickly.

These are the sacrifices and choices that certain asian families seem to make. I can extrapolate on anything if you need me to.

To hear this called privilege by the left is pretty offensive and insulting to my parents and grandparents who sacrificed so much free time and hobbies and money and energy to provide me with a better life. The fact that asians have to score 250 points higher on the SAT's never mind padding their extracurriculars, is punishment for hard work and good decision making. Also the 20-30 hours a week of time I studied at home. I remember my mom telling me, ""In the US, Asians have to score higher on the SATS, so you have to work harder than other people. This is reality.""

Now can you tell me on average Americans and other groups make this level of sacrifice for education? Where they spend all their extra income to sacrifice for their kid's education?",0
"Choices that my parents made as 1st generation Asian immigrants by taking out loans and sacrificing:

First, they came here, and left me, a newborn with their parents in their home country. They came to NYC, got minimum wage jobs, worked and saved money until they became stable. A year and a half later, they had my sister. Due to this, my parents waited a few more years I was 5 years old to send for me. Huge sacrifices already.

""Don't talk to strangers and go read books while I shop.""

In south Korea, it isn't uncommon for lower class parents to work extra to pay for extra tutoring or extra classes at private businesses for their kid's future. Unfortunately, South Korea and Japan have some of the highest suicide rates in developed countries and this amount of stress can also have far reaching consequences. 

Also Koreans and I think Haitians have started their own radio stations in certain areas like NY/NJ. They translate local and national American news to Korean. This serves as a information network, which along with parents gossiping helps a lot of useful information to spread quickly. 

These are the sacrifices and choices that certain asian families seem to make. My Indian friend, told me how his mom has had the same clothes for years, to save money for their mortgage or to help with his tutoring or college fees. I can extrapolate on anything if you need me to. 

Now can you tell me on average Americans and other groups make this level of sacrifice for education? Where they spend all their extra income to sacrifice for their kid's education?  


Another example: In my home country, my grandfather wanted his 4 children to be educated. He was born in 1935. He took out loans to pay for his children's college education. Due to his low income, it took him until 2010 to pay it off. He had to save money by penny pinching and refused to buy meat for a long time to save up the money to pay it off.   


To hear this called privilege by the left and somehow insinuated that this is due to white people giving us privilege is pretty offensive and insulting to my parents and grandparents who sacrificed so much free time and hobbies and money and energy to provide me with a better life. The fact that asians have to score 250 points higher on the SAT's never mind padding their extracurriculars, is punishment for hard work, time invested, delayed gratification, good decision making. Such as the extra 20-30 hours a week of time I studied at home. I remember my mom telling me, ""In the US, Asians have to score higher on the SATS, so you have to work harder than other people.

" I'm wondering what I can do in this situation:

Moved out at the end of July. Landlord is withholding a good amount of security deposit for damages that were there when I moved in. Had pictures of a lot of it but is still withholding for generic ""wall damage"" and ""not cleaning"". There was small nails/ holes in the wall when I moved in where old tenant hung pictures. I spend 6 hours scrubbing the place down and left it much much cleaner than when I moved in. The landlord also had violated many health codes refusing to deal with mice which ate all my bedding/furniture ect despite asking for 6 months to fix it. Maybe all the mice made it dirty again before they inspected.

I'm trying to figure out what the best law to go after them with. I'm thinking the security deposit return timing is cut and dry.

I read some laws that the landlord has to repay the security deposit in 14 days along with a list of deductions. Mine made the check out 25 days later and refused to give an itemized list until multiple emails which ended up being 1.5 months later. Am I correct in saying they have no right to withhold anything now? I'm basing the argument on this link
https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GOB/7-108

Also I had to let them know I couldn't renew a little less than a month beforehand. There is nothing in the lease and I couldn't find a law saying I had to give more notice. Is there a law I couldn't find?

They had agreed to give a small amount more back but its been a month more and no response or check. I said thank you for giving more back but will require the full deposit back (and then went into reasons). I have not brought up laws yet or threatened litigation.

Any advice in how to proceed would be great.",0

"I decided to ride my bike from FiDi to Upper West Side today to see a friend.

I rode for a while, and the amount of for lease signs in every single neighborhood and almost every single block frankly jarred me.

Boarded up businesses. Mom and pop shops. Chains. Restaurants, cleaners, empty storeforents. You name it. 

For me, it was a painful reminded of what Covid has taken away, besides the lives and health of many. 

NYC will bounce back. But we have a long way to go. But this is just really depressing, because behind those close businesses are jobs, and people, and families that had it all taken away from them in a flash.",0

"Tattooed folks and tattoo artists of Astoria/NYC! I'm raising money for sick kids through Extra Life this year and have raised over $6000 in support of Children's Miracle Network and Cohen's Children Medical Center (in NY).

I had set up a bunch of incentives (like getting waxed live on stream) to help raise money. One of my coworkers donated $1000 (plus an additional $1000 to be matched by our company) on the condition I get a Papa Smurf tattoo.

Ideally I would love to do this live on stream as part of the fundraiser! I'm looking to get Papa Smurf in a ""Fighting Irish"" pose - I'm thinking about 2-4 inches tall. Haven't decided where yet, probably my leg or my butt.

If anyone knows of someone who would be willing to do a house call and willing to let me stream this on the afternoon or evening of Saturday, November 7th - that would be amazing.

NOT A REQUIREMENT: Ideally I'd love it if we could crowd-source the artist's usual rate and donate that to the cause in lieu of the normal fee (I would of course still be giving a sizeable tip). That said, I understand its a really difficult time for a lot of artists and I'm happy to pay full price for this.

This is a really amazing cause, and any help achieving this goal of doing the tattoo live on stream would be so wonderful.

Of course, I'm happy to share a link to the page which includes evidence of the donation and request.

To anyone who's interested in donating, please message me for the link (I'm not posting publicly just for privacy reasons).

"Long story short, I lost almost everything because of the pandemic in New York, no job, no income so I just started a small business selling handcrafted snack. I can't afford to open a store (you know that crazy NYC retail rental rate) so I made an online shop first. Hope things get well, I can only sell and ship within New York States now because of Home Processing regulation. The snack I make is a nougat-like snack in bite-size, made from various nuts, milk, biscuits, and dried fruits. I have been selling for a while now offline to friends and family and they totally love it, a lot of them return for more, I really believe this could be big, maybe something like Baked by Melissa or Lady M.

Anyway, I got nowhere else to talk about this, I lived in NYC for almost 20 years and started this here. Feels like it may fit in this subreddit. I don't want this post removed so I am not going to post anything such as a link or name related to my business to avoid being viewed as spam or ad post. I hope one day I can open a small shop in the city for everyone to enjoy it and become a brand that started out from NYC, then I will come back to read this post again to witness the birth of a brand. Any advice are welcomed, I feel like in NYC anything is possible!

"So I did this once before in NH, and the NH DMV issued me this thick paper temporary plate to put in my dash while I drove my private party purchased car from NH to NY.

"First, let me say for the most part I don't think NYC is, or will, look like it did in the 70s and 80s. That said, today I had a moment where I was like ""ooh...ok I can see it""


I'm rent stabilized, grew up in my apartment, know the building like it's a good buddy. Right now there are 11 empty units out of 20. Of those 9 occupied apartments, 6 are also rent stabilized. Same deal as me, people who have lived there forever. The 3 market tenants seem to buzz everyone into the building willy nilly. 


Today I heard some commotion in the hallway so I run my ass down to see what was going on. I found my super banging on one of the empty apartments - he told me someone had been squatting in it. Kind of makes sense because I had noticed some odd things but assumed new tenants moved in.


I actually like my super so I joined him in the door bang. Eventually some dude came out with all his shit and told us he was ""waiting for his broker"" - we had a good laugh at that and told him to fuck off.


My super then tells me this is the second squatter they've had in the empty units in a few months. I remember a couple weeks ago someone rattled my door handle, but they boogied when I asked who it was. 


Super tells me it's happened in his other building, too. People know these apartments are empty and are trying to sleep in them. I tell him that sucks, remind him he said he'd re-caulk my moldy bathtub a month ago and end it there. 


That SAME night, I hear someone in the hallway on a floor that I know is empty. Low and behold, another guy is going door to door, checking to see if any are locked or have shitty locks (as these new doors all seem to). I yelled at him and he left.


In short: THIS feels like the late 80s and early 90s. I only had to deal with squatters as a kid. The only difference is back then, they were all doing heroin.


MORAL OF THE STORY: Lock your doors and stop buzzing people into your fucking building if you don't know who they are. 


If they say ""FEDEX"" don't be lazy, go check. 


If your gut tells you they are bullshitting you, they are. Don't let them in.",0
"Walking around in a chain drug store earlier this week, I see this guy at the refrigerated shelf in the back of the store, just grabbing one after another bottle of something and stuffing them into his sizable backpack. 

I only really saw him grab one or two, he was probably finishing up, so I don't know how many he had exactly in his bag. He had a mask and sunglasses on, so I don't know what he looked like, but he was a big, 20-something white guy, definitely not yuppie, a little rough-looking with a hand tattoo. 

I didn't really give it much though, people shop with their own bags all the time. But he had a nervous energy and didn't even stop to let me pass, and I had to double back to get to the other aisle. 

He finishes up and starts quickly walking towards the register, where there's a huge crowd. I'm curious, so I go look at the shelf he was at. It's empty. It used to hold Odwalla juices at about $4 each and there's not one bottle left. I watch him, and he walks around the crowd, past the guard, and out of the store.

Well, there goes my assuming the best in people. 

So first, I wasn't going to stop or question him because I didn't think he was doing anything wrong. But admittedly, I might have rationalized that because he was big, rough-looking and a little threatening-looking to me. 

Then again, what could I have done? He hadn't done anything wrong until he walked out of the shop.

But as my suspicion of shoplifting grew, I also thought, what can I do, scream after him? For what could be three Odwallas? Until he left the shop, he could have just quickly turned to another shelf and made like he was browsing. 

Besides, what he had in his bag was perishable, it's not like he was loading up on batteries or pseudoephedrine and this is a chain store with margins to account for shrink, not some mom-and-pop place.

I hear a lot about how retail folks, even guards, aren't supposed to stop people anyway. Why make myself a target to call out some potentially dangerous? I don't blend in easily and this is my neighborhood, where people can find me. 

Then I thought, even though this is a chain store, there are employees behind it, and they may suffer because of something like this. Shoplifting raises prices for everyone. 

And I don't want New York to become a lawless place where criminals do as they wish. I also thought he might have grabbed those Odwallas to resell to a dishonest retailer in the neighborhood in return for cash.

I'm not sure how to feel about this whole experience. I don't feel too guilty for letting it pass, but I hate to keep silent when people do wrong as well. What do you think? What would you do? Is there more I can or should do?

Should I have contacted the drug store then or even after, to let them know what I saw?",0

"Those violations. But here is the thing, I haven't owned that car for the last 5-6 years due to the fact it was booted, towed, then sold. The license plate number is surely not on file anymore. And I still owe that $363 in order to get my license again. So here's the other thing, I still have my title with the color, make/model, license plate number on it. And now both the tickets that say I owe 'x' amounts for have completely different license plate numbers attached to them and one of them I'm able to view the ticket and it says that my car was a red Nissan, and my car was a blue Mercury Sable LS. The license plate number on either of the tickets does not match. The color, make/model on the one ticket I can see does not match either. And both of the license plate numbers on both ticket are different themselves, so one ticket had one plate number while the other had a different plate number.

"Hi everyone,

I've been applying for jobs lately (Marketing Coordinator) and I'm getting calls back within a day or two and 3 different companies have expressed interest in in-person interviews. 

Am I the only one who thinks they're tripping? I don't understand why a Zoom call wouldn't be superior in every single aspect in the current circumstances, there's literally no need for an in-person. 

Are these companies to be trusted? Is this normal to see such a quick turnaround but lack of concern for safety? Seems sus. Also are office people just transitioning back almost normally now?",0

"Not to sound like an alarmist but it's great so many dogs and cats are being adopted but my greatest fear is that when things go to somewhat normal, people who adopted animals to help them shelter in, will return their family member to a shelter.

I have a friend who volunteers at a shelter and they are even preparing for this reality to happen. How someone could do that to an animal to me is heartless.

 As a longtime dog owner when people see me walking my dogs on warm summer days, they report that they would like to get a dog. I always tell them to wait until it's Winter when it's cold and snowy outside and see if you feel the same way.

Also you're agreeing to give up sleeping in one the weekends, once you return to work, running home to let the dog out, planning your vacation around your dog as you find where to take them while you're gone and finally a realization that vets are costly,

New post that isn't fueled *as much* with scotch and sleep deprivation as the previous, so should be a bit more coherent and easier to understand.

No TL;DR cause fuck you. I'm giving out free fucking groceries. Read the fucking post. 

I put up a post and surprisingly didn't receive *any* PMs requesting groceries, so here I am again. 

# I am aiming to provide 70 households from Reddit within NYC with the options of:

A) Ten lbs. of drumsticks  
B) Eight lbs. of quarter chicken legs *or*  
C) Six and a half lbs. of drum sticks with a dozen eggs

Ideal candidates are those that are unable to eat the free food provided by the city due to food sensitivity, conflicts of religion, culture, health reasons, etc.^(1) This is aimed to help those that are seriously in need of assistance, with a heavy preference given to the elderly, young students, immigrants, folks that don't quality for any or limited assistance, etc. Communities that have historically been disfranchised, you get the idea. Families that have children enrolled in NYC public schools should be receiving $420/child/month for food^(2). If the aid is still not enough, I'm your guy. While this is geared towards Redditors, if you know someone that isn't on Reddit but is also really struggling, shoot me a PM with their info. This is going by honor code for everyone, so square up with your maker on your own time. 

# If you're trying to get groceries, send me a PM with the title ""Groceries, *insert borough, insert neighborhood, insert which option*""

In order for this to work, I'm going to ask for some assistance from the Reddit community. Due to the limited space of our shop, I am not going to have folks congregate at the business trying to pick up their orders. That being said, I need a couple of Redditors with the means come and pick up the bulk orders, however many of which type that will be, and prepare and segregate the orders off premise. Logistically, this means: 

\- Someone/s with a vehicle to accommodate and transport  
o 700lbs of drums, *or*  
o 560lbs of quarter chicken legs, *or*   
o 455lbs of drums and 70 dozen eggs, *or*  
o *Most likely* some combination of all three  
\- A clean space/location to prepare these orders, ideally commercial   
\- Folks who have a food handling certificate to prepare the orders  
\- Someone/s with a vehicle to accommodate and deliver the orders to whoever needs them 

I am asking for volunteers and free labor because I'm broke as shit and I'm unable to make this happen on my own, within my own means, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for assistance in the first place. Volunteers will be provided face masks. 

If you‚Äôre a MVP and trying to help me out with the pick up, splitting and bagging, delivering, etc., PM with the title ***Grocery Help, Driver/Location/Food handling*** (choose whatever role you can fulfill)

I would like to continue being able to do this, so shameless plug: our Venmo is still the same and hasn‚Äôt changed @ FourSevenDivisionStreetTrading.

"I've lived in NYC for 6 years, and got a cheap used car last month. It's been an amazing way for my wife and I to 1) get out of the city easily for short trips, and 2) use during times I don't feel like taking public transit because of difficult circumstances.

Some details: I live in Morningside Heights, and only do street parking. In the past month, it has taken max an hour to find a spot, and usually it takes about 5-10 minutes if I do it during the right time of day/week. The alternate side parking reform has also made this process significantly less stressful, as long as I'm vigilant during the hour and a half period I have to get a new spot.

Riverside drive is also an absolute godsend for finding a free spot in my area. There's just so much street parking there that you almost always find at least one spot every time I need one.

I'm posting this for those that might be considering getting a car but can't afford a garage fee, or are seeing the strong negative opinion/experience most people share about it. If you stroll your neighborhood, take a look around and see if there's commonly a spot or two available in your vicinity on weekday afternoons. If so, that's probably a good sign that street parking is viable and worth pursuing long term. Having a car in NYC can be a great experience during these times - this may change for me but so far I love it.

In the past moonth, I've used the car to: 1) Visit parents in NJ twice, 2) Go camping, 3) Drive to CT for a small get together, 4) Take my cat to the vet for an emergency appointment, 5) Get some free furniture off of Craigslist, and 6) Get my wife down to Times Square for an appointment she was late to.

An important Hasidic wedding scheduled for Monday in Williamsburg could be a big test of the resolve of state and city officials to enforce infection reducing lockdown rules to keep [COVID-19](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/covid-19/) clusters in check.

As CBS2‚Äôs political reporter Marcia Kramer reports, New York City is hoping to avoid a repeat of a gathering last Sunday in the village of New Square, Rockland County, where thousands of Orthodox Jews thumbed their noses at social distancing and mask rules enacted by the state.

The gathering could be responsible for a new spike in infection rates. According to [Gov. Andrew Cuomo](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/andrew-cuomo) the positive test rate in Rockland County red zones ‚Äì including New Square ‚Äì was 11.26% Thursday ‚Äî up from 8.40% the day before.

‚ÄúSome of the complexity of the enforcement here, especially with members of the Orthodox community, they never comply with the rules,‚Äù Cuomo said.

New York City official hope to avoid d√©j√† vu all over again on Monday in Williamsburg where, according to flyers obtained by CBS2 the grandchild of Satmar Grand Rebbe Zalman Leib Teitlebaum is scheduled to be married. The worry is that the wedding, with events scheduled at 152 Rodney Street and 590 Bedford Street could draw thousands, not only from Williamburg, but from the Satmar community in Rockland County.

The positive rest rate in the Brookyn red zones also rose. Thursday it was 5.47%, up from 4.75% the day before.

Although the wedding venues are not in any of the [COVID](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/covid-19/) mini-cluster zones, officials are still worried about the spread of infection.

‚ÄúCity Hall is in discussions with the state on issuing the proper guidance. Large gatherings without social distancing and masks are severe public health risks and all guidance will be enforced. We are looking for community cooperation and hope to see all public health guidelines followed,‚Äù said [Mayor Bill de Blasio](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/bill-de-blasio)‚Äòs Press Secretary Bill Neidhardt.

Sources say officials are trying to get the Satmar community to limit the number of people at the indoor ceremony. The concern is how many show up outside and whether it will require a large contingent of police.

On Saturday, Kramer learned authorities served an order to the Congregation Yetev Lev D‚ÄôSatmar to cancel or postpone the wedding if it is not limited to 50 people.",0

I'm Meisner trained, in sag, have a few low level agents and a low level manager, I get really awesome auditions (when I get them) but I'm finally starting to notice some small hints of progress after doing this for a few years now. (like a tape I had for an office last week, I read for them for the 1st time 13 months ago). I've since branched out into filmmaking and just submitted my first short I wrote/directed/produced that I'm pretty proud of to film festivals. I also have some experience in development, pitching to producers and agents, etc. I feel like for me I have way more experience than I give myself credit for, and it's really just about finding the right people to build my team / collaborate with, then just being patient and putting one foot in front of the other until I achieve my goals. I've had a couple pins for co-stars on network shows and my first call back last year, I know I'm circling the drain of landing my first tv credit, which is exciting.

but yeah, I'm really interested in meeting other actors to be friends with and maybe help each other out with self tapes, or other writer/producers to collaborate and produce something together, or anybody that works in any facet of the industry, we can exchange instagrams or something! I'm really trying to develop a large network of people that helps each other out on projects and lifting each other up to the next level!

"**ALASKA FOOD MARKET** on 17th Street x 9th. Chelsea.

This place down on my corner is absurd. I understand that there's probably a considerable amount of overhead to run a grill during the day and operate 24 hours against larger corporate stores, especially during a pandemic. I don't ever get upset if I'm overcharged a bit if I decide to buy a 12-pack at a bodega but even if you are in competition, I despise shady business techniques.

1. Insanely overpriced in general on any given item, as if they took the tags at another store and slapped an extra $2 on it. Almost smug how they do it.
2. If you buy more than ONE item, the owner will quickly shuffle it all into a plastic bag and charge you for the bag (maybe I should have been more perceptive about him bagging my shit but it's one of those things you don't even think about if they don't ask). I didn't even know these stores had plastic bags in stock still.
3. He gives you customer itemized receipts and if you pay with card, he throws in a random percentage charge. I've heard of cash discounts but not card upcharges.

If you're familiar with this stretch of 9th Ave, there is an abundance of reasonably priced bodegas with very friendly owners. I only go here on last resort. Why is this guy still in business?

Anyway, on to my dispute reasoning

1. Its a handwritten ticket, and one of the numbers/letters on the license plate section is completely illegible (most of the handwriting is very sloppy honestly)

2. I've seen countless people park where I've parked with no tickets, and the arrows are fairly confusing as the 'no standing' sign could very easily be pointing towards the fire hydrant which so many people park next to (which is what I thought) 

3. There's no yellow paint. Well, unless you look really *really* hard -- and even then it's faded to hell. 

4. I tried to pay it already, but of course since it's handwritten it's not even in the system yet. I know these things take time but, I figured that was worth adding.

Any advice is much appreciated",0

What's your other big idea, ban raising cows within 50 miles of NYC to prevent Prospect Park from being overrun with cattle?

"&gt;I don‚Äôt really understand why you‚Äôve waited this long to presumably ‚Äúfollow the rules‚Äù / listen to medical professionals only to throw it away at the end?

That's a good question, and deserves a respectful answer. 

In a nutshell: I do not think the amount and extent of restrictions are commensurate with the risk. I understand that a very small number of people will die or get sick if they get infected, but it's been clear for months that most people will not, especially if they are young and healthy. And while I am willing to make small sacrifices to mitigate a small risk and large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk, I am not willing to make large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk. It doesn't make sense, and I'm not going to do it. 

Now, I do understand that some people are more vulnerable to this thing than others, and I am willing to make a large sacrifice to protect them. I hate my mask, but I wear my mask to protect the vulnerable. I am going absolutely insane without my usual outlets and social activities, but I understand that sacrificing those social activities helps protect people who have a good chance of dying or experiencing severe symptoms if they get sick, so I am going to do what I can to protect them. 

But once those people have the opportunity to get vaccinated, the calculations change. And nobody has the right to force me to make large sacrifices to mitigate a small risk. 

That's how I feel, anyway. I hate all these restrictions. They've been very hard on me. I'll follow the guidelines to prevent widespread suffering, because that's part of being civilized. But once widespread suffering is off the table, so is my compliance.",0

Hmm... as for my level, I don't really have a number. There was a time when I supported the lockdown in NYC, when it first started in mid-March. The numbers were so crazy and we didn't know what the virus was capable of. I flipped when I had a good idea of what the risks are and how quickly people are dying. 270k is a lot of people, but a drop in the bucket compared the 3 million that die per year of other causes. Also keep in mind the actual number is probably lower than 270k  since hospitals are incentivized to report covid deaths. e.g., someone has both covid and AIDS and dies, there's a big incentive there to list that as a covid death.",0

"Republicans aren't fascist because they're throwing a kegger.  (That's the ""death cult"" part, not the ""fascist"" part.)

They are protofash because of their contempt for democracy and rule of law, demonization of the free press, embarrassingly unironic machismo, scapegoating of immigrants and minorities, eagerness to cast opponents as ""traitors"", opposition to political and cultural pluralism, worship of military power, overt corporatism, and embrace of sexist stereotypes.

The [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism) and [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism) articles are both quite good, albeit long.  As a more digestible summary of ""ur-fascism"" (the most common, if contradictory elements of fascist thought patterns past &amp; future) I'd recommend [Umberto Eco](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/).",0
"**[Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism)**

Fascism () is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, democracy, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left‚Äìright spectrum.Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants.

There were women with baby strollers continuously using the elevators and going between the first three floors (as in, getting on the elevator on the 2nd floor, taking it up to the 3rd floor, etc). And very often there was a security guard doing the same thing -- but only patrolling those first three floors. 

And they were always very rude, for example when one would get on the elevator as I was going up and I would ask ""going up?"" to make sure they were getting on the correct elevator (it's rare to see that many people going between intermediate floors all the time). After a couple scoffs I stopped asking.

"&gt;What kind of papers do they want to see? As citizens we're not obligated to carry proof of citizenship nor do we have green cards.

In theory, at *interior* Border Patrol checkpoints, [if you're a U.S. citizen, you have the right to refuse to show your ID](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/cbp-cant-detain-domestic-flight-passengers-refusing-suspicionless-id-checks). As you note, U.S. citizens are not required to carry proof of citizenship when traveling domestically within the country.

In practice, I strongly recommend carrying proof of citizenship, such as an Enhanced driver's license or a U.S. passport card. All too easy for a power-tripping agent to break the law and illegally arrest you for not being able to prove your citizenship on the spot; this [apparently happened **300 times over 4 years at a single bus station**](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17490904/customs-border-protection-patrol-checkpoints-100-miles-legal)!

Much better, if it comes to it, to be able to prove your citizenship on the spot if forced, and then file a complaint afterward, than get (illegally) arrested/detained for hours on end and have your day (or more) ruined. Either way the agent is unlikely to face serious discipline for breaking the law, so you might as well do yourself a favor and minimize your risk of getting illegally arrested.",0
Am I seeing a different image than you? I‚Äôm a little confused.,0
"There's another line the right wing has drawn, too, which has never made much sense to me. At the state level, they support voter ID laws almost reflexively, the stricter the better. They also support tying issuance of state driver's licenses to not only proof of identity but also proof of citizenship. At the federal level, they support mass domestic surveillance conducted by the NSA, which scoops up - among many other records - every website everyone ever visits within the U.S.

Yet, despite being *perfectly fine* with ever-more-stringent state ID requirements, and despite being *perfectly fine* with federal mass domestic surveillance, they [cry foul at the very idea of a national ID card](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/24/blocking-the-pathway-to-a-national-id/).

Seconded. I'd add the hassle - especially during a pandemic - of cleaning and disinfecting the car, gassing it up between rentals, taking it in for regular maintenance, etc. (oil changes every six months; car washes every 2-3 months; getting your tires and brakes inspected regularly and changed every few years; annual emissions inspections...).

Like if you're currently in between jobs, or a 'house spouse', or something, maybe you don't mind the effort in return for a small stream of spending money. But if you both already have full-time jobs, I really don't know that it's worth the hassle of becoming a small-time ""car landlord"".",0

Maybe complain about the fuckin' office buildings who keep their fluorescent lights on at night and the construction sites that have hundreds of incandescent bulbs kept on at night before complaining about super efficient LED lighting.

I truly think all of it, including the narrative of widespread systemic racism, was blown way out of proportion and unfortunately, the police were vilified as a result.

"I'd argue that institutional racism harms black, Latin and Native American individuals in America much more than Asian-Americans and other groups not mentioned above simply because there has been more time and more specific institutions dedicated to holding those groups down than others. Yes, we can point to a few specific instances of anti-Asian laws and actions in America like the Chinese Exclusion Act or the Japanese internment camps, but for the most part America did not have large populations of Asian-Americans until the late 19th century, whereas America and its antecedent institutions as British colonies have been predating on black and Native American peoples for centuries, and while ""Latino"" is a relatively recent cultural designation historically most Latin people in the Americas would definitely be counted as black and/or Native American and would be discriminated against as well.",0

Broadway is closed, a lot of restaurants are either closing or balancing indoor/outdoor dining. Parts of New York that are really fun like bar hopping or tiny cool restaurants just have a different vibe. They also have a 10pm curfew right now, so it‚Äôs not the city that never sleeps kinda place. There is a subdued art scene (or at least that I‚Äôve seen) too. There are also almost no tourists and significantly less commuter workers, which means less people out and about and less traffic. Both of which are nice but not usual NYC. If you fall in love with quiet covid NYC, you will might not enjoy it when everyone comes back and your smashed like a sardine on the subway or it takes 20 minutes to go 5 blocks in a cab.

"I don't believe this should explicitly be made illegal, seem to be bifurcating commerce. When online and other businesses don't accept cash, yet if you operate a storefront, its illegal for you to not accept cash. Shouldn't this be the businesses choice? Why is this regulation so narrowly focused to store-front only point of purchase businesses?

I'm also interested to hear which group(s) have standing to have been caused harm by not accepting cash? I'd guess its low-income peoples who don't have cards? You could easily argue that banning card-only business could effect these people, however they do have access to pre-paid cards and businesses that operate non-cash are highly unlikely to have customers that are cash-only.

These workers should have been phased out decade ago. Relics of the past.

This program was approved while Byford, someone who worked in other HCOL cities with metros, was at the helm in his attempt to make the subways a world class system.  It was a program that diversified the responsibilities of the Station Agent.  And as far as earning 6 figure salaries, if a worker was going to put in their time, it is not uncommon to make 6 figures, but be honest about the numbers, making $100,000/yr means they spent atleast 60hrs/wk at work as opposed to going home to their families.

Doesn't matter. Try running it non-profit. Or anything at all.

Yes it's an essential government service. Which is why it's long been used as a way to extort city taxpayers. 

It was built a hundred years ago, and shouldn't only need upkeep and maintainance, which should cost much less than what we pay.

To not privatize it, is to simply allow the MTA to keep demanding more and more, even as users dwindle. Tokyo is the biggest city in the world and their metro has been privatized for the same reason.

The administrative overhead of that is going to be ridiculously expensive, inconsistent, easily gamed by all the people you really wish to target, and where a bunch of people you weren't trying to target get caught up in it.

You've got all sorts of different ways in which the it's difficult to determine how much someone is ""worth"".

- Mommy and daddy have millions and I live off their money? No income, no wealth, I'm poor.

- Farmer who's barely making a dime but the land is worth money (in theory, although buyers for random chunks of Upstate NY may or may not exist)? I'm wealthy even though my bank account's empty!

- Most business owners and really wealthy people shove most or all of their wealth/assets behind LLCs and other entities not exactly ""theirs"" legally. The taxes may get paid, but trying to determine ownership or how much ""wealth"" that means the owner has at any given time, is complicated and difficult.

This will all get even harder with out of state drivers where the state doesn't even have their tax records, as well.

"**[2007 Brooklyn tornado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007 Brooklyn tornado)**

The 2007 Brooklyn tornado was the strongest tornado on record to strike in New York City. It formed in the early morning hours of August 8, 2007, skipping along an approximately 9 miles (14 km)-long path, from Staten Island across The Narrows to Brooklyn. The worst damage was in and around Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn. The U.S.

&gt;Combined, the initial red zone areas in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland  and Orange counties now average a 4.5 percent positivity rate, compared  with a 7.9 percent positivity rate the last week of September. That  soaring rate at the end of September is what prompted the renewed  restrictions, which were initially put in place for two weeks. That  window expires Thursday.   
&gt;  
&gt;Brooklyn's orange zone areas will move yellow, which allows schools to  reopen with mandatory weekly testing, while its yellow zone areas will  remain yellow. In Queens, the north red zone and the orange zone both  turn yellow, while the north yellow zone remains as is for now. Cuomo  said he also adjusted the cluster zone map to capture a recent uptick in  the Ozone Park neighborhood.   
&gt;  
&gt;In the Far Rockaway cluster, the red and orange zones also turn yellow  while the yellow zone remains in its current precautionary  categorization. The situation hasn't sufficiently improved in Rockland  County, despite some progress, Cuomo said. Those maps don't change.  Orange and Broome counties' maps don't change either.",0

The economy has changed a lot in the past decade, with software taking an enormous share of the city's engineering resources. Advanced manufacturing is less labor intensive than large-scale fabrication, which characterizes a lot of the last decade of manufacturing job growth across the shale patch.

Is it possible that Trump may actually steal the election?,0
"Ok what you need to do is obviously have the tax returns. Luckily landlords are desperate right now so you can use that to your advantage. The landlord is going to wonder why your income jumped so you will need to explain this. The landlord will wonder how steady your cashflow is. If you have a boost this year but it is not steady into next year then I would not expect to get the apartment. But if you can show business income for the previous 2-3 months and show that it is steady and explain why it went up then you should be fine. Some landlords would want a letter from your accountant to serve as an ""employment letter"" since you can write whatever nonsense you want and say you earn X amount this basically certifies the tax returns you are providing.

In summary, I wouldnt' jump through too many hoops right now because landlords are extremely desperate there is no need. Just be upfront and make sure you qualify for the apartment with the 40x requirement based off your actual income. If you are simply projecting income that doesn't fly.

Also having a guarantor either a real person or one of the guarantor companies will solve all of your problems. Personally that's the route I would go to guarantee I get the apartment.",0

"It isn‚Äôt just the slogan, but the conflation of this initiative with other aspects of police reform, and the general posit that we are all unlettered, blood-thirsty murderers.

I think it‚Äôs probably incorrect that it will prevent large numbers of mentally ill people being killed by the police; many of the mentally ill subjects of lethal force by police listed by the Washington Post are, upon closer examination, extremely violent people armed with weapons.

I began looking at new places and as soon as I found one I liked I made a low-ball offer to see what happens.

I did not get attached to any one apartment I just made a bunch of offers to apartments I liked to see what the market was like. I did not negotiate for concessions but instead negotiated actual rent and for two years.

A few places refused to negotiate and barely lowered rent from their 2018 standards so I ignored those. A few others negotiated to my low-ball offer.

I found a place much lower, 2 bed at 1700 and accepted the offer.

My current landlord then offered to stay at $2000 about a month later which I refused. Now the place will remain open for a while.

So find places you like and make low-ball offer to them. Check the listings around to see how low rents can go.

Also do not pay a fee. Seriously. If a landlord is making the tenant pay the fee that apartment should stay open forever.",0

People who are in regular contact with a whole bunch of people (e.g. waiters, grocery stores workers, etc.) should probably get tested regularly. My suggestion is **not** that people should _always_ avoid getting tested.

I stand by my example of couch potatoes who never see people generally shouldn't bother getting tested. Each test costs _someone_ (or more realistically, some government/insurer) ~$100 which is actually non-trivial. To do some napkin math, there's something like 330 million people in the US currently. If every person gets tested once per month for a year, that'd be 3.96 billion tests. If each of those tests costs $100, the cost would be $396 billion. If each of those tests costs $10, that'd be $39.6 billion. Both are enormous numbers.

"&gt;	Because u/nypd employees are too busy jerking each other off to QAnon, it‚Äôs somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it‚Äôs not okay for us to confront you.


It‚Äôs literally not enforceable. Not on the subway. Especially not as a general policy. 

Millions live in NY and ride the subway every day. 427 stations in the system with multiple entrances. 

There are approximately 1200 cops patrolling the entire system (+ some special plainclothes teams intended for more serious crimes I assume). 

Somebody can come in with a mask then take it off while on the subway. People pull down their masks for a few seconds or minutes. 

They‚Äôve been instructed to offer a free mask before issuing any fines. So, once again, someone could put on the mask and take it off later. 

All of these facts don‚Äôt include the conservation about prioritization. Focusing our time on enforcing a mask mandate is a waste of time (imo). Especially when we‚Äôve seen more violent crimes committed on the subway in recent months (stabbings, pushing onto tracks, etc.). 

Furthermore, we‚Äôve only discussed the subway so far. Mask mandates are even more difficult (if possible at all) to enforce outdoors. We‚Äôve made outdoor dining permanent, which requires people to remove their masks. Someone could walk down the street or sit in a park while ‚Äúeating a bag of chips‚Äù for two hours to avoid wearing a mask. Just have a bottle of water with them and say their mask is down because they were just drinking water. So many other reasonable excuses. 

Finally, based on your sentiment and generalizations towards the cops in this post, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say you‚Äôre in favor of defunding the cops (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). If so, more prioritization will be needed. Violent crimes and emergencies will be far more important than mask adherence. Once again, ~1200 for a system with 427 stations (some are very large like TS and GC) and ~5,000,000 people a day. Fining every individual who doesn‚Äôt wear a mask is just impractical. 

&gt;	it‚Äôs somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it‚Äôs not okay for us to confront you.

Who are you referring to? The cops who don‚Äôt wear masks or the riders? It sounds like your talking about the riders. 

If so, nothing is stopping you from confronting them lol. That‚Äôs not a smart decision but it‚Äôs a decision you are allowed to make. People tell you not to confront them because the absolute best case scenario is they‚Äôll ignore you or tell you to fuck off. But go ahead. If you‚Äôre not right next to them, though, it will come off as though you‚Äôre trying to start trouble.

The attitude here is more relaxed than months ago obviously but we're still not at the careless levels much of the country is in and with people putting little to no effort into avoid getting or spreading it (not wearing masks, visiting friends and family all the time, attending Trump rallies mask-less, etc.) while at the same time their infection rates are much higher right now.",0

"Well, as far as freedom of speech goes, Democrats have advocated for censorship on multiple different occasions. For instance, Joe Biden wants to get rid of Section 230, which is key to freedom of speech on the Internet.

[https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/](https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/)

Freedom of religion is not about ""protecting people from the religions of others,"" it's about preventing governments from practicing religion and criminalizing others from practicing religion. A government cannot establish a religion, it must be secular. It's typically defined as: ""a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.""

Thus, it is in the free speech of people to practice (within their own private company) discriminatory practices. By virtue of the free market, businesses that practice discriminatory policies would not get lots of customers and would have to adjust in order to survive as a business. This is all included in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Higher taxes aren't doing anything when we're already trillions of dollars in debt. Instead of just collecting more taxpayer money, we should reinvest this into good healthcare, ending poverty and hunger. We have a lot more money than you think. Also, higher taxes = worse economy and worse economy = more unemployment and more unemployment = more poverty and hunger. Lower taxes would better help ameliorate poverty and hunger in this country.

That list is not at all accurate for the reasons I outline in my previous comment. Scandinavia is ranked on the Economic Freedom Index to actually be higher than the U.S. meaning that it is, in fact, more capitalist. Unless you think the U.S. is socialist, then Scandinavia and all of Western Europe is very much capitalist. You're confusing capitalism + a few regulations to make sure it's kept in check and socialism, which is when everything is owned by the government/people. That's a completely different system, and more in line with Zimbabwe/Venezuela/Yugoslavia type systems.

Also, my last paragraph did not include any ad hominems. I merely claimed that Trump has not turned America into an authoritarian oligarchy, as you claim he did and wants to. His system is just as liberal and democratic, as any other president (with the exception of Nixon and Bush). I'm also not ""alt-right."" I'm not sure why you get this impression, as I would consider myself to be a centrist, possibly leaning towards the left. I'm pro-choice, pro-free healthcare, pro-immigration, anti-death penalty, pro-same sex marriage, and anti-war on terrorism.",0

Mitch McConnell has been a senator for longer than most millennials have been alive.

"Stop and frisk is from a law enforcement only view which as I mentioned is not a holistic solution as it narrowly focused on crime metrics. For the PC issues, there are cultural and societal factors, as pointed out that often police are not the same demographics or live in the same areas as they police. Cultural issues also do matter. What works for say Chinatown won't work for a non Chinese neighborhood. So say for example if there is a correlation between single parents and teenage crime often politicians avoid addressing directly and focus on increased law enforcement. Or if there is such thing as negative influence from gangster rap or lack of role models such areas are also ignored or avoided.",0
"I'm happy to have a civil discussion, but it has to be honest discourse.

If he had said he voted Trump because of the economy, or positions against abortion or immigration - I'd have disagreed vehemently, but at least there'd be some basis.

But voting Republican because of your support of science, when in the middle of a pandemic the party has been taking deliberate steps to weaken the Center for Disease Control, has outright been anti-mask and social distancing (a measure proven scientifically to be effective and that has worked in numerous countries throughout the world to control the virus and with great economic benefit), has been the only G7 country to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.

I would say the problem is that no one has the vision to address issues holistically and in a rational approach. NYPD is not a monolithic entity where everyone is a bad guy. For example bail reform was initiated after discovering high numbers of juveniles going to jail for offenses such as stealing a bookbag when no one's looking. A step in the right direction but no one goes to ask why are there so many teens committing these crimes and what could be done to set them on a different path no matter the cost or long term focus required.,0

"&gt;Or if there is such thing as negative influence from gangster rap or lack of role models such areas are also ignored or avoided.

Damn, I haven't heard someone blame rap music for crime in like a decade. That's some seriously old school ignorance right there. 

Maybe these points aren't addressed because they aren't actually substantive issues, but instead are racist stereotypes that people use to divert from the legitimate, systemic problems with law enforcement?

My theory is that politicians have conflicts of interests with the root issues that increase the conflicts between police and the communities they work in. For example real estate industry is driving gentrification and ny politicians are deeply tied to the real estate agency. Believing the money offsets the negative consequences of gentrification.,0

3. my uncle .. a dominican male in his mid 60s. runs a multi million dollar international company. voted R because he's in the 1% and doesn't want to pay more taxes on his private jet.

"yes, exactly. in america we the people have the suffrage, we have the vote, but we don't call the shots. politicians speak kindly (or not so kindly) to the cameras but take the same big pharma/health insurance/real estate/auto industry money. behind senate doors they'll hug their ""most detested enemy"", talk about how their millionaire buddies across the aisle aren't all that bad, and basically enable trump's agenda which they ostensibly hate but do very little to actually stop.

He also expanded the surveillance state resulting in Snowden being a whistleblower who Obama condemned as a traitor.

* **Brenan Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who‚Äôve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected $9 billion budget shortfall.**
* **Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving companies and tech start-ups tracking smartphones all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year.**
* **For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined.**

Like many before him, [Brenan Hefner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenanhefner/) arrived in New York 20 years ago in search of a career on Wall Street.

His journey will sound familiar to those drawn to the nation‚Äôs financial capital. Hefner got a job at an asset management firm in Manhattan, found love and career success, and eventually moved to Pelham, an upscale town in Westchester, to start a family.

He would still be there if it wasn‚Äôt for the coronavirus pandemic. When Hefner, co-founder of a research platform called [Analyst Hub](https://www.analysthub.com/), sold his house this summer to a couple from London, he wondered if it made sense to look beyond the surrounding neighborhoods for a new home. He ended up moving his family to Dallas last month.

Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who‚Äôve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected [$9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-faces-toughest-fiscal-crisis-since-the-1970s-11598205600) budget shortfall. While the city is no longer the national virus hotspot it was earlier this year, those leaving cite anxiety over the region‚Äôs economy and quality of life and a conviction that higher taxes are coming. Last month, business leaders [publicly upbraided](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/nyregion/de-blasio-economy-coronavirus.html) Mayor Bill De Blasio for ‚Äúdeteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs.‚Äù

By forcing the mass adoption of remote work and crimping many of the advantages of urban life, the pandemic has turbocharged migration from high cost, high-density places to lower-cost states including Texas, Florida and Nevada. Nearly half of New Yorkers earning more than $100,000 a year said they considered leaving the city recently, with cost of living being the top factor, according to a Manhattan Institute [survey](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/survey-nyc-high-income-earners-future-work-and-quality-life).

‚ÄúThe cost of living down here is significantly less,‚Äù Hefner said by phone from his new home. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no state income tax. I‚Äôm not riding mass transit during the middle of a global pandemic to get to a subway to live in a [WeWork](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/wework-says-it-will-file-request-to-withdraw-its-ipo-prospectus-after-roadshow-management-turmoil.html) or something.‚Äù

For Brenan, the pandemic showed that for those in financial services, the gravitational pull of New York still exists, but is far weaker. He says he is about as effective operating his business over Slack and Zoom, and plans on flying to New York monthly for client meetings. His company, founded in 2018, helps star Wall Street analysts leave big banks to form independent research shops.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs a requirement to be in the city anymore,‚Äù Hefner said. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt love the city, I do. It‚Äôs an amazing place, but as far as a family of five, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the right place for us at this time.‚Äù

## ‚ÄòEverybody‚Äôs leaving‚Äô

Even within his 19-person start-up, Brenan has company. [Caroline Goodson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-goodson-33917927/), his director of corporate access and sales, left Manhattan after a homeless encampment popped up outside her apartment building. She also moved to Dallas.

His co-founder [Michael Kronenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-kronenberg-4a352815/), who owns a downtown Manhattan apartment, has spent most of the pandemic outside of New York, renting a succession of houses in places including Scottsdale, Arizona; Vail, Colorado and Sullivan‚Äôs Island, South Carolina. For senior finance professionals not chained to a trading floor, moving to lower-tax states has never been more appealing, he said.

‚ÄúEverybody I know is leaving,‚Äù Kronenberg said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just New Yorkers. My partners, long-time clients and investors of mine that live in Connecticut or New Jersey, they are used to commuting in to the city. They‚Äôre never going to commute in five days a week ever again.‚Äù

The coronavirus pandemic has caused the worst global economic crisis in living memory and taken 230,000 American lives so far, with New York City claiming one-tenth that grim figure. Downtown and midtown business districts are still a shadow of their former selves, depriving local businesses and the city of much needed revenue. A [record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/30/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage) daily case count in the U.S. and surges in Europe have New Yorkers bracing for a tough winter.

But since moving trucks began clogging city streets this summer, New Yorkers have been incensed by the idea that the place De Blasio refers to as the ‚Äúgreatest city in the world‚Äù is on the cusp of a multi-year decline. An ex-hedge fund manager‚Äôs LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/) that declared ‚ÄúNYC is Dead Forever‚Äù prompted a withering [response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/opinion/jerry-seinfeld-new-york-coronavirus.html) from Jerry Seinfeld.

Many of those who remain say the city is more livable than before, with streets closed off to car traffic and restaurants taking up more outdoor space. Of course, the city has bounced back from every calamity in its history, from the 1918 Spanish flu to the suburban flight of the 1970s, the terror attacks of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.",0
"Part 2 of 2:

## Falling rents

But it‚Äôs hard to deny the signs of pain ahead. Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving [companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/new-yorkers-flee-for-florida-and-texas-as-mobility-surges) and tech start-ups tracking [smartphones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/upshot/who-left-new-york-coronavirus.html) all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year. More than 246,000 New Yorkers filed a change-of-address [request](https://abc7ny.com/7-on-your-side-investigates-pandemic-exodus-leaving-nyc-fleeing-new-york-city/6386411/) to zip codes outside the city since March, almost double the year-earlier period, for instance.

That‚Äôs reduced demand for Manhattan apartments, where median monthly rents [fell](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-real-estate.html) 7.8% to $2,990 in the third quarter, part of a city-wide decline not seen since 2010, according to StreetEasy.

To be sure, the New York area‚Äôs suburbs have been the primary beneficiary of the exodus: Home sales in Westchester jumped 112% in July, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. Sales in Greenwich, Connecticut just had the strongest [quarter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/greenwich-home-purchases-soar-to-a-decade-high-on-nyc-exodus) in more than a decade.

For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined. Meanwhile, states including Florida, Texas and Nevada don‚Äôt tax wages. The more people make, the greater the incentive there is to leave, and the difference could easily mean hundreds of thousands more dollars in after-tax pay.

That‚Äôs a trade that some Wall Street titans have already made. Hedge fund billionaire [Paul Singer](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/09/13/paul-singer-on-the-markets.html) is moving the headquarters of Elliott Management to Florida from midtown Manhattan, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-21/singer-s-41-billion-hedge-fund-moving-headquarters-to-florida) this month. His move follows that of another billionaire, famed corporate raider Carl Icahn, who made the switch [last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/carl-icahn-is-said-to-be-heading-to-florida-for-lower-tax-rates) to avoid New York taxes.

## Busiest in 40 years

‚ÄúMy concern isn‚Äôt that they‚Äôre leaving, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre taking their businesses with them,‚Äù said [Mark Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-klein-370901ba/), a New York-based tax attorney and chairman of Hodgson Russ. The flight of business owners is worrying for those remaining in the city, he said.

Still, it has kept him busy. Klein says he has ten times more clients now than pre-pandemic, helping advise people who make more than $800,000 a year move to low-tax states, often bringing their businesses along. Besides hedge funds, Klein said that a spectrum of professional services operators are leaving, including public relations and accounting firms.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been as inundated with people leaving New York and Connecticut, any of these high-tax states, in my 40 years of doing this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce Covid hit, with the recognition that people can work from any location, the floodgates opened.‚Äù

The stakes are higher in an election year, with many in finance convinced that higher taxes are coming if [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/) wins and Democrats take the Senate. Within [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GS), multiple traders have told me they are voting for Biden ‚Äúagainst their own financial interests‚Äù because of his stated plan to raise taxes on those earning more than $400,000 ‚Äì an easy threshold to exceed on Wall Street.

And to a person, high-earners I spoke with said that the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions from President Trump‚Äôs 2018 overhaul hurt them personally and believe that local governments are going to seek more money from them in coming years.

Leavers aren‚Äôt limited to hedge fund traders and portfolio managers; New York is also home to a growing ecosystem of fintech firms.

When fintech CEO [Paraag Sarva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psarva/) bought a weekend home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania last year, he figured he‚Äôd probably rent it out most of the time. But months into the pandemic, after it became clear that full-time, in-person schooling in New York was unlikely for his small children, he made it his permanent residence.

His new neighborhood, studded with horse farms and multi-acre estates, is vastly different from his old home by the expressway in Brooklyn. Two other families from New York have moved in recently, he said, and they have brought their businesses.

His start-up, [Rhino](https://www.sayrhino.com/), which replaces renters‚Äô security deposits with a small recurring fee, is still based in Manhattan. But Sarva rarely returns; he has managed the firm‚Äôs [explosive growth](https://medium.com/@psarva/the-new-normal-what-covid-19-is-teaching-our-team-53adb0abc57f) from afar. During the summer, the company doubled its employee count to 90 and raised $14 million in additional capital.

While schooling and quality of life were the main drivers of his move, the lifelong New Yorker wasn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúleave money on the table.‚Äù His taxes are 10% lower in Pennsylvania, he figures.

‚ÄúOnce we made the decision, we did consult our tax and legal advisors on what exactly that would mean,‚Äù Sarva said. ‚ÄúI am officially a Pennsylvania resident. I voted here, registered my car here, have a Pennsylvania driver‚Äôs license. I‚Äôve moved out of my former home and have no intention of returning.‚Äù

## ‚ÄòLess boring‚Äô

In some finance circles, even people who may not have permanently uprooted their families like Hefner or Sarva are pushing for a tax break. They are typically city dwellers who moved full time to their second homes once the pandemic struck.

‚ÄúThere are a bunch of people I know trying to get out of the NYC tax, they‚Äôre living in the Hamptons, Westchester, Connecticut or New Jersey,‚Äù said a managing director at a major global investment bank. Another colleague who worked mostly in New York moved her residence to Delaware, he said. He declined to be identified speaking frankly about taxes.

The executive owns condos in Manhattan and houses in Sag Harbor, but has spent most of the pandemic in New Jersey. After a three-hour meeting with his tax consultant, he plans on filing taxes as a Jersey resident to avoid New York‚Äôs 3.9% city tax. He and his friends are [risking an audit](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/09/14/new-york-city-income-tax-coronavirus-squawk-box.html), which can happen three years after he files his 2020 taxes.

In the meantime, he‚Äôs worried that his expensive Manhattan properties will lose as much as 40% in value in the coming years.

‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs gonna feel sorry for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe good news is, maybe the city will get less boring.‚Äù",0

"As someone who is moving on Sunday purely because internet this hits home. I'm a former Optimum customer in the poorer part of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Between internet going out multiple times a day, severe 10-20% packet loss, and like periods of week long instability, it's a total non-starter. Literally I can't work without internet.   


Optimum? Well anyone who has dealt with them knows how they operate. You call no one helps you. You get jerked around, told someone will call you back, you never get a call back.  So you complain on their ads and eventually their social media team tries. Though eventually that falls through. The technician says yeah it's the tap, then they have another guy come out to argue it isn't, and back and forth we go.   


Someday, I'm going to document in full how insane my dealings with them has been. But I'll just give a snippet of the last month. So 9/19 they were going to send a technician out to fix my internet. Waited the entire Saturday, watched the tracker like a hawk. Said they wouldn't be out until like 7pm. Still was at home, 3:30pm suddenly nothing is on the tracker, I reach out to the social team like what the hell. Get told he said I wasn't there, I'm like my wife, dog and I are right by the door all day, there's been no one home. So the social team after a lot of push back admits he lied, gives me a service credit for my troubles. Awesome.   


But wait a month later, I see credit is 43.00 and the missed service appointment is $80 on my bill. I'm like what the fuck. So my wife decides to handle it. She calls them, gets a guy named Waleed, he says he'll help and it's taken care of we'll see the bill change in two days. Great! No, nothing changed two days later. So my wife calls again. She gets told by this billing person they can't do anything, but a manager will call her. She never gets the call. So she calls again after the 48 hours. Gets told this time she has to go to the Optimum store. So she asks for a manager because she doesn't think it's great to go to a crowded store in a pandemic. Manager says you have to go to the store. She goes to the Optimum store. Optimum store says you have to go to billing. And then billing says they can't help her. So we go to retentions to get it removed since she was  told they fix things. They did not. Her process in this was like 20 hours of her time.   


That's not including my 40 proceeding hours getting them to attempt to fix something before we finally said fuck it we're moving, it's too expensive to lose my job because internet.   I hate them. They have a monopoly and they got you by the balls. You literally can't do anything unless you are willing to move.",0

"No, VAS plates do not allow you to run any lights. They don‚Äôt give any privileges what so ever. If you are an ambulance service you have to register with the state DOH all of your emergency response vehicles. They give you a orange sticker to put in the window denoting EMS emergency vehicle status, but this also makes said vehicle subject to ‚Äúpart 800‚Äù DOH inspections. There is a state DOH EMS authority that can literally pull over ambulances/response vehicles and inspect them/put them out of service in case of violations.

EMS can have unmarked cars but it‚Äôs usually reserved for on call supervisors who don‚Äôt want to advertise to the whole world they are in a response vehicle while going about their day and the state really doesn‚Äôt like to approve them. Most agencies only have a handful of unmarked cars for chief level and above supervisors. They are required to meet minimum equipment standards and can be inspected at an time.

The Long Island counties do allow for green ‚Äúcourtesy lights‚Äù for the volunteers in their personal cars, but they can only be used when one is formally dispatched to an assignment and I believe they don‚Äôt allow you to run red lights or speed. A buddy of mine who is the chief of a volly in Long Island has had to pick up more than one over eager young EMT after the troopers towed their car for misusing courtesy lights.

I was volunteering at a hospital in the city and didn‚Äôt even know there was a blackout until I went outside for lunch. The hospital had backup generators. Everyone was pouring into the streets and 9/11 was still fresh in our minds. One of our first thoughts was is this a result of a terrorist attack? I remember walking all the way home and it felt like I was at a parade on the Brooklyn Bridge. People were passing out water bottles and snacks along major roads. Boom boxes were blaring music. It felt like a city of 8 million was having one big block party in the summer while we wait for electricity to come back.,0

Forgive me for double dipping here, but I just can't get over this line. You realize that this is true for basically **every american**, right?  Americans lost more in the last 7 months than any other year in their lives. This is the worst fucking catastrophe to hit the US in about 100 years. Americans lost more family members in the last 7 months than any other year in their lives, students lost more teachers in the last 7 months than any other year of their lives, teachers lost more students in the last 7 months than any other year of their lives, doctors lost more patients in the last 7 months etc... ~300,000 people are dead who should be alive right now. It'll be well over 500,000 in a few more months. If you were in NY then you remember what it was like when every day there were 1500 people dying and the bodies were piling up...

"Problem is demand is up from the new luxury high rise that were just built, but supply isn't really much higher because the apartments are unattainable to all but the mega rich (who likely don't stay in the city much out of the year anyway). So for you and me our rents go up.

Sure, constructing market rate housing may ease the pressure on real estate prices. Ultra luxury high rises are not the answer is though, unless you're a billionaire.

As for ""Supply generates its own demand?"" - of course it does (when it comes to real estate). People want to live where the people and businesses are. That's why cities are expensive to begin with.

I‚Äôm sorry that a decentralized republic carved into 50 different autonomous pieces did not respond as quickly as one of the most culturally disciplined and systematic countries in the world.

My only point is that the seeding of covid in this country was inevitable and due to the nature of the culture the federal response will always be handicapped. I am not giving Trump a pass for his failings, but there is no mainstream politician who would have handled this any better. In the end it was the governors who are ultimately responsible for the deployment and decision making in their respective states and they are as much at fault as the feds are for this disaster.

Trump fucked up with masks. But the much more direct and measurable aspect of the outcome was the regionalized healthcare response and infection control. Especially around vulnerable populations i.e nursing homes.

The president and congress likely don‚Äôt have the authority to order local nursing homes to take or not take in covid patients. Only the state executive can do that through local emergency powers. Given that AT LEAST 40% of deaths came from nursing homes, I will lay the blame for those cases at the ultimately bumbling response of many governors who were more interested in point fingers and juxtaposing themselves against someone easily condemnable instead of being held accountable for the crisis unfolding in front of them. The federal government will NEVER have the sophistication and knowledge to execute responses at the local level. This country is simply not set up that way.

If this is too nuanced of a take for you then fine. You‚Äôre looking to give power to an equally incompetent and corrupt group of people merely because they are slightly more sophisticated in their presentation. Enjoy being just another cringey anti trumper willingly ignoring the real problems with our system because it‚Äôs easier to hate than it is to be productive.

"Oh I know there's been people gathering and walking. But their efficacy is questionable at best (my 2c). 

And yes, you are right that in theory SCOTUS is supposed to be that way. A lot of our government is supposed to theoretically function according to certain rules and norms. What actually happens isn't that, and I think for a lot of people it doesn't matter. If any form of government matters, it would be any executive position (the face, the most visible parts) followed by a distant 2nd being legislators followed by an even more distant 3rd in the judiciary. This plays out in every single election - voters turn out and money is spent way more on those three in that order, descending. 

Something like lifetime appointments is certainly something worth criticizng and debating, but youre talking to someone who thinks the entire theory of US government is hot garbage that needs to be thrown away, if I may be blunt. The constitution is frankly stupid. No reason to be poetic. its bad. its dumb. There are better ways to do liberal democracy, and there's no reason why we can't adapt new ideas (I'm being rhetorical, there are plenty of reasons, but theyre all steeped in cynicism and ""power is corrupt"")

My points mostly is that something like a scotus confirmation is something that simply does not register on most peoples radar. Most people want the classics - stable job and housing etc. Even if you draw a throughline from SCOTUS appointments to day-to-day action (which you certainly can) it wont matter because at the end of the day, SC Justices aren't telling local legislators and executives to do stuff. Frankly they dont evne tell local judges and prosecutors to do stuff. Thus, most people aren't going to be compelled to march on the street because Amy Coney Barrett is a new justice.",0

But we didn't.  Bc the trump admin treated this as a political crisis, not a public health crisis.  Cuomo and even that idiot di blasio were calling out the feds for not only fucking up by not having testing ready, but actually blocking state and local authorities from having ability to do their own tests.

"None of what you said has anything to do with Cuomo hiding the number of nursing home deaths in New York.

You're literally using the same deflection strategy Cuomo does when he is asked for transparency. 

&amp;#x200B;

The federal government's many failures in responding to COVID-19 is not mutually exclusive to state-level failures, and furthermore, has absolutely nothing to do with Cuomo refusing to disclose the actual numbers.

What does Trump have to do with Cuomo hiding his state's nursing home death statistics? Is the White House somehow preventing the New York Health Dept. from being honest with their data?

&amp;#x200B;

Cuomo peddles in disinformation by comparing NY's official numbers to other states, considering NY uses a different metric than literally the entire country which under-counts by design.

And it is amusing to see Cuomo claiming the push for accountability and transparency is a political hit from Trump and ""right-wing media"" when local news outlets, AP, and ProPublica, among others, have been asking the same questions for months.",0

"That article was published 7 months ago.......

Why do lockdown skeptics insist on showing old information and assume it's still relevant today? 7 months ago, New York was at it's peak....the curve has clearly been flattened since then. I don't think I'm missing anything...Just look at New York's numbers TODAY, and compare it to states right now in the midwest that are experiencing massive spikes. New York was essentially one of the first states in the US to get it bad and have their spike. We've learned a lot since April. We had less resources available to us 7 months ago, we've learned more about the virus itself. Of course cases were going to spike. But the virus infected roughly 500,000 people in New York State. Nearly 20 million people live in New York State, 8 million of whom live in the city. The virus didn't ""run out of hosts"" like that article seems to imply. If New York hadn't taken the measures they did, many MANY more people would have gotten infected. Info from 7 months ago doesn't really represent where we are at today. Our worst point was over half a year ago. Just look at the data, it doesn't lie. Clearly the midwest states have failed to learn from New York's experience earlier this year. New York has every reason to be doing horrible right now, given the dense population in the New York City area, and the use of public transit, and yet despite all of that, the infection rate remains around 1%. The other states have 0 excuse to be doing as bad as they are right now.",0

It has generated 1 billion since becoming legal:

[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/colorado-passes-1-billion-in-marijuana-state-revenue.html).  

If we assume their *best* months at 24 million a month the whole year, that's 288 million dollars.  That is best case scenario.  Yes, a lot of money.  But still less than 1% of a [32.5 billion dollar a year budget](https://leg.colorado.gov/explorebudget/)

See how that massive tax prediction just fell short in just a few minutes?

I'm not sure how many poll workers are hired per site but let's say there's 30. That's $8400 per day spent on wages already.

Completely going off memory here, but at my polling site there were like 6 tables with 2 people each, 2-3 people by the 3 voting machines to make sure the voter put in the ballot successfully and it got counted, than a handful of people directing people inside the polling location and outside the lines giving updates. I'm sure each early voting site is staffed slightly differently.

I'm guessing there are other expenses like paper, pens, tech, voting machines, etc. as well. Then training of the polling site workers.

**What Will New York Real Estate Look Like Next Year?**

City planners, developers and local officials weigh in on how the pandemic could change the city‚Äôs housing markets, land use and policy.

The economic collapse fueled by the pandemic could reshape New York‚Äôs real estate industry, from public and affordable housing all the way to the overbuilt luxury condominium market.

**By**¬†[**David W. Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-w-chen)¬†**and**¬†[**Stefanos Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/stefanos-chen)

One in five New York City tenants did not pay rent in September, by one estimate, and there is growing concern of ‚Äúan eviction tsunami.‚Äù

As apartment vacancies climb, sale prices and¬†[rents are falling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-rental-market.html), but nowhere near the magnitude needed to compensate for scarce affordable housing options.

And while the flight of affluent residents to the suburbs appears to be overstated, major companies are downsizing and fewer people are commuting, setting the stage for a new reckoning over personal and business priorities.

Real estate is everyone‚Äôs business in New York City. The industry generated nearly $32 billion in taxes last year, 53 percent of the city‚Äôs tax revenue, and it employed more than 275,000 people, according to the Real Estate Board of New York and labor statistics. An inveterate source of obsession, envy and frustration, real estate colors the aspirations and agendas of countless people, companies and policymakers.

So how the industry weathers an unparalleled economic collapse fueled by a global pandemic will reshape not just the chronically underfunded public housing system and the overbuilt luxury condominium market, but also virtually every aspect of urban life.

To assess what might happen in the next year or two, The New York Times interviewed nearly 50 people, including former senior city officials, real estate executives, affordable housing advocates, urban planners and brokers.

When will the real estate market recover, and what will it look like in terms of supply, demand, and prices?

Will New Yorkers be more open to development in their neighborhoods, or will they be even more resistant?

How will housing, transportation, retail and commercial real estate be affected in the broader New York region?

The outlook is daunting. Unemployment in New York City¬†[is still 14 percent](https://labor.ny.gov/stats/pressreleases/pruistat.shtm), after hitting 20 percent in June and July. The hotel occupancy rate¬†[is 39 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/nyc-tourism-coronavirus.html), down from 95 percent this time last year, according to the research firm STR. Roughly one-third of the city‚Äôs 240,000 small businesses¬†[may never reopen](https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf), and¬†[iconic retailers like Neiman Marcus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/realestate/how-will-hudson-yards-survive-the-pandemic.html)¬†are closing.

Residential real estate sales plummeted¬†[40 percent in July, and 57 percent in August](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-18-september-28-2020/), compared to 2019, according to the New York City Comptroller‚Äôs Office. Commercial sales were¬†[down 28 and 43 percent in July and August, compared to last year](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-11-july-27-2020/).

Still, many experts predict that New York will eventually bounce back ‚Äî as it always does, citing the eventual rebounds after the Great Recession, 9/11 and the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.

The Manhattan skyline, awash in vacant offices, as photographed from the observation deck at Rockefeller Center in August. Remote work has already had a profound effect on the real estate market.¬† ¬†¬†

**What Will Happen to the Market?**

Rents and sale prices will continue to drop in the next year, significantly so in some areas, but likely not for the people who need relief most.

Rents in the New York metro area ‚Äî including parts of New Jersey and White Plains ‚Äî are projected to drop 7.7 to 11.3 percent by the middle of next year, from the first quarter of 2020, according to Andrew Rybczynski, a managing consultant with CoStar Advisory Services, a commercial real estate data provider.

After the 2008 recession, rents fell nearly 10 percent in Manhattan because of high unemployment and rising vacancies, said Nancy Wu, an economist with the listing website StreetEasy.

The median rental price in Manhattan, including concessions, was $3,036 a month in September, according to the brokerage Douglas Elliman. That is an 11 percent drop from the same period a year ago, but still far beyond the means of most New Yorkers. Citywide, the median rent last year was $1,467 a month, according to the New York University Furman Center.

Rents will continue to drop citywide, in the absence of a vaccine, Ms. Wu said, but that trend masks affordability problems in several neighborhoods hit hard by the coronavirus.

In¬†[an analysis](https://streeteasy.com/blog/covid-19-nyc-rents/)¬†of neighborhoods with the lowest rates of infection ‚Äî affluent neighborhoods like Battery Park City and SoHo in Manhattan ‚Äî rents dropped 1.9 percent from February to July, largely because of rising vacancies. In the hardest hit neighborhoods ‚Äî including East Elmhurst in Queens and Fordham in the Bronx ‚Äî rents have actually increased 0.3 percent in the same period, and a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic renters, many in the service industries, have shouldered that burden.

‚ÄúNew York has been a tale of two cities ‚Äî not just in terms of the pandemic, which is known, but also with rent affordability,‚Äù Ms. Wu said, noting the dearth of options on the lower end of the market.

In sales, the boroughs beyond Manhattan are expected to recover sooner, because they are relatively less expensive, and proximity to Midtown is no longer a top priority. In August, Brooklyn¬†[exceeded the pace of sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/realestate/brooklyn-real-estate-sales.html)¬†recorded the same time last year, and Queens is on a similar but slower trajectory, according to StreetEasy.

Discounts of under 10 percent are widespread, but prices have yet to plummet, except in the ultraluxury tier. Buyers waiting for fire sale prices may be disappointed, because the market was already three years into a price correction before Covid-19, Ms. Wu said.

It is less clear what will happen in the saturated new-development market. Out of more than 20,000 condo units citywide that have come to market since 2018, nearly 60 percent remain unsold, said Kael Goodman, the chief executive of Marketproof, a real estate data company. That represents $33 billion of unsold apartments, and about 2,000 of those units have not yet even begun sales.

So far, the glut of new luxury inventory has not resulted in many distressed sales, in which units may be sold in bulk to investors at deep discounts. To avoid foreclosure, some scenarios could involve converting condos to rentals, or restructuring loan obligations. Industry observers expect to see more of these actions in the months to come, as developers run out of options to satisfy lenders.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ‚ÄòRoad Runner‚Äô dynamite scenario: The fuse is burning, but it hasn‚Äôt blown,‚Äù Mr. Goodman said. ‚ÄúWhichever way things break, there will be buildings that will have to be traded.‚Äù

**What Happens to Real Estate‚Äôs Political Clout?**

In recent years, the real estate industry‚Äôs clout¬†[has waned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/nyregion/real-estate-industry-nyc.html)¬†as local legislators have leaned increasingly to the left, and campaign contributions from the Real Estate Board of New York¬†[have shriveled](https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/9565-campaign-donations-real-estate-lobby-drop-dramatically-democrats-decline-new-york). In July,¬†[progressive challengers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/progressive-primaries-ny-legislature.html), like Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a housing counselor, toppled incumbents viewed as too moderate.

City and state legislators are mulling an apartment vacancy tax and other measures to discourage speculative investment, while opponents warn of a ‚Äúdeath spiral,‚Äù in which over-taxation could scare away the wealthy. The highest-earning¬†[1 percent of New York City residents](https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/nycs-high-income-tax-habit/)¬†generated 43 percent of city income taxes and 51 percent of state income taxes collected from individuals living in the city as of 2016, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank.

But more than any statistic or legislation, the most consequential factor for real estate is what will happen on June 22, 2021.

That is the date of New York City‚Äôs next primary election, and it will be the most consequential since 2013, when Bill de Blasio, bolstered by his¬†[‚Äútale of two cities‚Äù campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/nyregion/de-blasio-shifts-away-from-his-re-election-message-of-one-city.html), swept into office. Now, with term limits forcing out a deeply unpopular Mayor de Blasio, along with most of the City Council,¬†[a wide-open battle for the city‚Äôs leadership](https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9596-who-is-running-for-what-office-2021-new-york-city-elections-mayor-city-council)¬†is underway. And real estate interests say the stakes have never been higher.

The city‚Äôs next mayor will need to address urgent land use and housing issues that have dogged the current administration even in a time of prosperity and freewheeling spending. A¬†[$9 billion budget shortfall looms.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/nyregion/nyc-budget-coronavirus.html)

Depending on what happens in the presidential election, it is too early to gauge whether voters will opt for, say, a technocrat like former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg or a rising progressive like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. One presumed favorite, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson,¬†[has already bowed out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/nyregion/corey-johnson-mayor-nyc.html), highlighting the unpredictable nature of the race.

‚ÄúWhat these two crises have laid bare is that this extraordinarily wealthy city which was doing so well for one segment of the population was completely failing other segments of the population, including people we now call essential workers, and communities of color, generally,‚Äù said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a former city planning official who is now dean of the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. ‚ÄúNow how can we use this pause to think about the city that should be ‚Äî a more equitable city?‚Äù

Some power brokers, like the developer Stephen M. Ross and Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, are¬†[already plotting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/nyregion/mayor-stephen-ross-daniel-doctoroff.html)¬†how to best use their influence and money to elevate their preferred mayoral candidate.

‚ÄúJust vote ‚Äî vote in the Democratic primary,‚Äù said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of CBRE NY Tri-State, a commercial brokerage, during a Zoom panel organized by the¬†[Partnership for New York City](https://pfnyc.org/research/a-call-for-action-and-collaboration/), an influential business group. ‚ÄúAnd get people to serve on the community boards who come from the world of business who understand the basic economics of the city.‚Äù

The city‚Äôs push to rezone SoHo, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for more affordable housing, could signal a shift in land use policy that had long favored redevelopment in less affluent communities of color.",0

**What Will Happen to Big Projects?**

In light of the virus‚Äôs disastrous effects on the economy, some believed the path forward for several stalled megadevelopments would be cleared, because of their promise of new jobs and infrastructure.

Instead, opponents have grown more circumspect, and the De Blasio administration, in its waning days, could push for something critics have long demanded: rezoning in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods, not the communities of color that have often been the reluctant recipients of major redevelopment.

A large expansion of Brooklyn‚Äôs Industry City complex, which developers said would create 20,000 new jobs,¬†[was quashed last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/industry-city-rezoning-nyc.html)¬†by opponents who doubted that claim and said the project would hasten the displacement of the largely lower-income immigrant community nearby.

Also in September, the city backed out of a proposal to build up to 15 mixed-use towers on 28 acres in Long Island City, where Amazon previously failed to garner support for its New York campus, because of local concerns about gentrification and inadequate infrastructure.

The Justice for All Coalition, a community group opposed to the project, explained in a letter in July: ‚ÄúThe proposed rezoning ‚Äî for the purpose of building luxury residential and commercial mega towers ‚Äî is exactly what this community does¬†*not*¬†need in the face of Covid and the urgent issues raised by Black Lives Matter.‚Äù

Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor under Mr. de Blasio, rejected that thinking.

‚ÄúThis is not the time to double down on the narrative that business is bad, that development is bad,‚Äù said Ms. Glen, who recently started a development firm, M Squared, which builds mixed-income housing in cities across the country. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt play to the cheap seats of being against everything and everybody.‚Äù

But the disproportionate harm the virus has caused to Black and Hispanic residents in lower-income neighborhoods has emboldened another view, critics say: That the argument is not simply pro- or anti-development, but a matter of where the effort is placed, and for whom.

So the mayor‚Äôs decision this month¬†[to back a rezoning in SoHo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/nyregion/soho-affordable-housing-development.html), one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for new affordable housing, is a significant moment, said Alex Fennell, the coordinator for the Racial Impact Study Coalition, a community advocacy group.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time the city has flat-out said, ‚ÄòWe need to put more affordable housing in affluent, white neighborhoods,‚Äô and that‚Äôs an important rhetorical shift,‚Äù Ms. Fennell said.

The proposal, which made scant mention of new housing when it was floated last year as a mostly commercial rezoning, is now seeking to allow about 3,200 new housing units to be built, including 800 below-market-rate apartments. The city has also signaled that a rezoning of Gowanus, a neighborhood in Brooklyn that is wealthier than several other neighborhoods eyed for redevelopment, is also a priority.

‚ÄúThere was an unspoken rule that you don‚Äôt rezone wealthy neighborhoods,‚Äù said Will Thomas, a board member of Open New York, a pro-housing group. While local opposition is already building, he said ‚ÄúSoHo is the first step in really showing that it‚Äôs politically possible.‚Äù

A public housing development in Chelsea. Major budget cuts are threatening both the preservation and building of new affordable housing.

**What Happens to Affordable Housing?**

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which funds and maintains much of the city‚Äôs affordable housing stock, suffered a deep cut this summer, when the city agreed to decrease its capital funding by 40 percent over two years.

Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a policy and advocacy nonprofit,¬†[estimated that¬†](http://thenyhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYHC-Policy-Brief-City-Budget-Cuts-10.6.2020.pdf)could translate into 21,000 fewer new and preserved affordable housing units and 34,000 fewer jobs, mostly in construction and related industries. (In a reversal, the city said Thursday that it would restore about half of the funding that had been scheduled to be cut.)

The cuts could delay or derail a number of once-assured projects. In Far Rockaway, Queens, an 11-building complex called Edgemere Commons with more than 2,000 units, all of which would be offered below market rate, was scheduled to receive city financing in December, but a backlog of stalled closings this summer means their project will likely be pushed back further.

‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre in limbo,‚Äù said Daniel Moritz, a principal at Arker Companies, the developer, which planned to begin construction this year.

Millions of dollars in predevelopment costs like architectural plans, legal fees and engineers can overwhelm developers awaiting funding, said Ron Moelis, a co-founder of L+M Development Partners. His firm expected to close city financing in June on the first phase of Bronx Point, a mixed-use project in the South Bronx with 542 below-market-rate units expected to be completed by 2023. Now financing has been pushed back until at least December.

‚ÄúAt the exact moment in time when we as a city know that we should be doubling down, the city is pulling back,‚Äù said Barika Williams, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of housing organizations.

In a September survey representing about 85,000 apartments in New York, nearly 20 percent of tenants paid no rent, according to CHIP, a group that represents 4,000 landlords and managers of primarily rent-stabilized buildings.

And unemployment figures do not show the full scope of struggling renters, Ms. Williams said, because many who are out of work or are underemployed were paid in cash, and therefore not recorded by official counts. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the brink of an eviction tsunami,‚Äù she said.

Experimenting with new methods to create or preserve more affordable housing is crucial, said Rafael E. Cestero, a former housing commissioner who is now president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit housing and finance company. He urged elected officials to ‚Äúchannel more rental assistance‚Äù to the neediest New Yorkers.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt build our way out of the housing crisis,‚Äù he said.

T[he Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/be-my-neighbor)¬†estimates that 500,000 new homes, including 100,000 in New York City, can be created ‚Äî and at minimal cost ‚Äî if state and local governments make it easier for basements, garages and attics to be converted into legal dwellings.

Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is running for mayor in 2021, is among those[¬†supporting plans to convert empty offices into housing](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/brooklyn-borough-prez-calls-converting-empty-offices-housing).

Meanwhile, the New York City Housing Authority, the landlord for one in 15 New Yorkers, is¬†[exploring new ways](https://www.gothamgazette.com/open-government/130-opinion/9631-promising-new-plan-to-save-new-york-city-public-housing-nycha)¬†to shore up funding.

**Is Suburban Flight Just a Fad?**

The demise of cities is overstated, experts said, but lasting changes will become more apparent in the years to come, especially in the work force.

With many companies discouraging employees from coming into the office until mid-2021, Barry B. LePatner, a real estate lawyer, predicted that the daytime population in Manhattan‚Äôs business districts would get dramatically younger.

While older employees will be inclined to stay at home, particularly if they are juggling child care and education issues, younger ones won‚Äôt want to miss out on networking and socializing opportunities. ‚ÄúI believe this will be a generational thing,‚Äù he said.

A¬†[report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/insights/covid-19/the-edge-volume-4/urban-to-suburban-the-growing-shift-to-the-suburbs-as-covid-19-changes-the-way-people-live)¬†noted that the demand for suburban office space, ‚Äúfueled largely by aging millennials,‚Äù was already outpacing urban cores.

More than 40 percent of U.S. bank executives also plan to reduce their office footprint to accommodate a partial work-from-home schedule, according to a survey by the consulting firm Accenture.

‚ÄúThe tether between work and home just got a lot longer,‚Äù said Jonathan Miller, a New York real estate appraiser. That shift is already increasing buyer demand in more affordable markets beyond the city center.

There are signs the suburban surge is slowing, as pent-up demand diminishes and prices there reach new highs, Mr. Miller said. While sales remain elevated, suburbs like Westchester and parts of Long Island saw contract activity peak in July.

But as the last seven months have reminded everyone, nothing in real estate is guaranteed.

Scott Rechler, the chief executive of RXR Realty and chairman of the Regional Plan Association, recalled a¬†[Sept. 1990 Time magazine with a heartbroken ‚ÄúI Love New York‚Äù logo](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601900917,00.html)¬†and the headline: ‚ÄúThe Rotting of the Big Apple.‚Äù The cover story mentioned a poll in which 60 percent of New York City residents said that they wanted to leave.

‚ÄúI keep this on my desk,‚Äù said Mr. Rechler, a former vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ‚ÄúI want to remind myself that our prosperity isn‚Äôt guaranteed. We need to continually maintain the quality of life that drives people to continue to want to live and work in New York City.‚Äù

Sure thing. Just pasted it above in a few comments.,0
"&gt; We're not European are we?

In March and April our response was very much compared to the ""superior"" European response.  Europe is now handily beating America when comparing per capita vs. per capita case counts.

&gt;Canada is at 6.7. There is absolutely 0 reason our northern brothers are outdoing us besides political incompetence. 

There are many factors at play.  One of the most obvious is that America has performed about 60% more tests than Canada.  The Canadian daily average is creeping upwards and may increase at a more exponential rate at any time (much like what happened with Germany over the past two weeks).  Canada could also have better leadership as you pointed out, or a population more willing to social distance, etc.

&gt;They have the same issue of anti-masker idiots. Same culture of anti-authoritarianism. 

Lol.  Americans are wayyyyyyyyy more likely to rebuke authority, for better or worse.

&gt;Mexico is even lower, but that's probably just because of lower available tests.

Mexico has a significantly higher CFR than America does.  And the testing infrastructure is undoubtedly way worse.

My point about Europe is that even the countries that ""got it right"" are experiencing a massive wave of cases.  COVID is much harder to contain than anyone would like to admit, especially in countries and cultures that are more individualistic in nature.",0

New York State spends more per pupil in terms of education spending compared to any state in the country, yet only ranks 25th best state for primary education. 

I lived in minority neighborhoods and went to public schools my whole life in New York. They've had free after school programs to helps students succeed at most of the schools I've been to (I moved around a lot as a kid), yet in almost every single one of them, the group that made up the majority of the students in these free programs were never Blacks or Hispanics, but Asians. One of the middle schools I went to was 70% Black at the time, yet the majority of the people who went to the free test prep program were Asian (Pakistanis, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis).

"I'm sorry you feel this way.  Everyone feels uncomfortable walking past an obviously mentally ill person, just hoping there's no confrontation.

One thing I'd recommend is to not give a fuck about hurting their feelings.

I recall reading a study long time ago about women on trains.  When a creep sat next to them making them uncomfortable, in a mostly empty car, many women would continue to sit still because of how they thought moving away would be perceived.

Don't do that.  If you feel uncomfo in anyway, run away.  Be vigilant, don't walk around with headphones at night.  Don't stand around blind corners.  Always make space between you and everyone else.  Don't give a fuck about how moving away makes someone else feel.

The odds of you being randomly targeted in a shooting is practically zero. In a moving subway car, practice moving between train cars if you've never done that before.  As long as you make space, don't hesitate to run, and carry mace, you can give yourself a little more peace of mind that you're at least prepared.  Also mentally visualizing the types of situations that could arise and how you would deal with them helps prevent freezing up in the moment.

To make matter worse, when math dept fight back saying ""we need to have standard, you cannot admit students that are not prepare for college,, you will have admin/politican/interest grp saying ""you cannot discriminate disadvantage students"". Yea, sure but how about improve your standard in grade school so that everyone graduates from high school actually, you know, have the knowledge of a high school kids.

At the end, the attack against Asian is just the easy way out for DOE because Asian, or I should say Chinese, never fight back and cant fight back.

And unfortunately right now, I dont see this happening because the conversation is all about racial issue, when was the last time someone actually take about ""what is being taught""?; also, parents who can afford to send their kids to private school/ or move to better school district (eg. Long Island) will do show at a even faster way due to covid, so what is left are parents who are less affluence, which usually means nobody give a flying fuck as long as DOE ""looks progressive""",0

Even in NYC, the 'good' outer borough neighborhoods remain safe. Fieldston and North Riverdale are still great. Same with Bay Terrace. Douglaston. Little Neck, Glen Oaks. Bayside. Jamaica Estates. Kew Gardens. Mill Basin. Marine Park. I could go on and on and on.

The decline in safety has really only happened in the Manhattan CBD, plus the UES and UWS, plus maybe a small handful of neighborhoods in northern Brooklyn. That's because offices remain closed, so no surge of office workers during the day; tourism remains dead, so no tourists roaming the streets; and many wealthy Manhattanites remain in their (even) more spacious digs out in the Hamptons or Westchester or Fairfield or wherever. The outer boroughs haven't been affected nearly as much because the residents haven't left (by and large), and they never relied on commuters or tourist traffic to stay afloat in the first place.",0

Let‚Äôs start with the good news: The iPhone 12, [the first with 5G](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-event-iphone-12-expected-with-5g-capabilities-11602581403), is indeed the fastest 5G smartphone. The speeds will knock your masks off, as we say in 2020.

Now the bad news: To see those speeds, you need to move really, really slowly. After locating your carrier‚Äôs high-speed tower, stand right next to it, tap download, then freeze.

Despite being marketed as our technological savior, 5G‚Äîthe next generation of cellular connectivity‚Äîis not a killer feature for the new iPhone 12 models. At least not in the U.S., not yet.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: The cellular speeds *can* be insanely fast. In some tests, it‚Äôs up to [30 times faster than my home broadband](https://www.wsj.com/articles/5g-smartphones-could-crush-your-home-wi-fi-so-wheres-the-5g-11597670710). Just persuade the marketing department at MetLife Stadium‚Äîhome of New York‚Äôs football teams and lots of [Verizon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ) [VZ **-0.09%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ?mod=chiclets)high-speed 5G antennas‚Äîto let you work on the field. (I did; see the video.) Just bring a power pack because 5G is a battery drain.

It‚Äôs best to think of 5G as an invisible feature‚Äîsomething that might one day come in handy. What makes this the best iPhone upgrade in years are a fabulous-to-hold design and substantial camera improvements.

Even those who bought iPhone 11 models last year might pine for these new ones. That said, I‚Äôve aimed my testing and assessment at those who have been holding on to iPhones that are in the iPhone 8, X and XS families‚Äîthat is, phones that are two or three years old by now. And yes, I‚Äôm also talking to readers I‚Äôve heard from who are still clinging to a prehistoric iPhone 6 or 7.

If you‚Äôre due (or overdue) for an upgrade, opting for an iPhone 12 is a no-brainer. But to select which of the four models to get, it‚Äôs best to group them together:

**‚Ä¢ iPhone 12 Mini ($699 and up) and iPhone 12 ($799 and up)**: [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL)‚Äôs [AAPL **1.32%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL?mod=chiclets)mainstream options have 5G, a new design and an improved wide camera. (They also have an ultrawide camera already found on earlier models.) The Mini has a 5.4-inch screen; the 12 has a 6.1-inch screen‚Äîotherwise, they‚Äôre identical. The Mini is available Nov. 13; the regular 12 is available Friday.

‚Ä¢ **iPhone 12 Pro ($999 and up) and iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099 and up)**: These also have 5G but come with a slightly more premium design and a trio of cameras, including the new wide one. The iPhone 12 Pro has the same 6.1-inch screen as the iPhone 12. The Pro Max has a 6.7-inch screen, and a new telephoto camera. The Pro is available Friday; the Pro Max is available Nov. 13.

Unfortunately, because of the later ship date for the Mini and Pro Max, I was only able to test the standard 12 and 12 Pro. Meanwhile, here are your key considerations:

## Aluminum or Steel?

You know that feeling when you cut your hair and it feels dramatically different for a few days? That‚Äôs this year‚Äôs iPhone design change. The squared-off edges, the rounded corners, the clean glass back make this the best iPhone design in years. It reminds me of a slick, grown-up iPhone 5.

I actually prefer the 12‚Äôs lower-end aluminum for its lighter weight. Plus, the Pro‚Äôs flashy stainless-steel frame is a fingerprint magnet.

Speaking of magnets, Apple put some in the backside of these phones so you can snap on its new MagSafe accessories. It‚Äôs a neat trick‚Äîat least in theory. The $59 leather wallet attachment is great for storing credit cards. Except a few times, when I slid it into my jeans, the magnet detached and the wallet flew off.

Then there‚Äôs the $39 MagSafe charger. While it charged the dead iPhone 12 up to 50% in an hour‚Äîfaster than a typical Qi-compatible wireless charger‚ÄîApple‚Äôs 20-watt wired charger took just 28 minutes. Plus, it has a short cord and the USB-C charging brick is sold separately. In an effort to save the earth, Apple removed that from the box. Don‚Äôt worry, I just reviewed [some better charging options here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-chargers-for-your-iphone-12-tablet-laptop-and-other-usb-c-devices-11602689252).

Though Apple makes other MagSafe cases, you may dare to make this your first caseless iPhone in recent memory. With a new ‚Äúceramic shield‚Äù over the glass and the new flat-edge design, Apple says it has four times the drop protection. The two phones slipped off a table onto cement and both withstood the fall without any nicks or dents.

"###### Two Cameras or Three?

The biggest decision between the 12 and 12 Pro comes down to a single camera.

Both have the same ultrawide cameras, which are great for capturing a whole scene. Both also have new wide cameras, updated with a wider aperture to let in 27% more light, according to Apple. In my low-light scene tests I could see a noticeable improvement over the iPhone 11, and big improvement over the iPhone X and iPhone 8.

So what‚Äôs different? The Pro adds a telephoto camera for taking closer shots. Whenever I would switch back from the 12 Pro to the 12, I missed the flexibility of being able to zoom into a scene without disrupting the action‚Äîa big thing for people with kids and pets.

The Pro also has a new lidar sensor, which [uses lasers to capture depth information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar). This will improve augmented-reality apps but also enables Night Portrait Mode, photos with that nice blur around the subject, even in low light. It did a nice job, but Portrait Mode still generally struggles with tough backgrounds.

###### G or Bust?

To really understand why you won‚Äôt see hair-on-fire speeds when you get a new iPhone 12, you first have to know the two types of 5G in the U.S.:

**Millimeter wave:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the Verizon 5G pole, honey. Be back soon!‚Äù This is my life when testing, because the fastest 5G doesn‚Äôt come to you. You go to it.

Named after its high radio frequencies, this is the blazing-fast connection Apple was bragging about during its event. In Jersey City, when testing Verizon‚Äôs Ultra Wide Band network, I saw download speeds as high as 3,000 megabits per second‚Äî3 gigabits! That is nuts!

Yet I could only do all that when standing right next to the tower. On my stoop, a block or so away, I can manage 800 Mbps. When I‚Äôm inside, I can only get 4G. This type of 5G can‚Äôt travel long distances, and obstacles like trees and walls can slow it down.

Verizon, [T-Mobile](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS) [TMUS **0.28%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS?mod=chiclets)and [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) [T **-0.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T?mod=chiclets)are putting up millimeter-wave cells in bigger cities and in public spots like stadiums and parks. That‚Äôs why I found myself at MetLife Stadium.

**Sub-6 5G:** Named for frequencies under 6 GHz, this isn‚Äôt as fast but provides far wider indoor and outdoor coverage. T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have substantial sub-6 footprints; Verizon just announced what it calls ‚ÄúNationwide 5G.‚Äù

The issue? This sort of 5G isn‚Äôt always better than 4G. Throughout the week, I saw speeds ranging from 30 Mbps to 160 Mbps on both Verizon and T-Mobile‚Äôs sub-6 networks. Sometimes the iPhone 11 Pro‚Äôs Verizon 4G connection would get the same speeds.

I wasn‚Äôt able to test AT&amp;T with the new iPhones yet, but in past AT&amp;T tests with Android phones, its sub-6 network was spottier than T-Mobile‚Äôs.

I did, however, see much higher speeds with these iPhones than with any 5G Android phones I‚Äôve tested so far.

Even when you‚Äôve got the knock-your-masks-off speed, what can you do with it?

I downloaded the first two seasons of ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù (about 4 GB) in less than 3.5 minutes on [Netflix](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX) [NFLX **-1.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX?mod=chiclets)and Apple TV, respectively, and a 2GB game in 45 seconds from the App Store. Speedier than my home broadband network, that‚Äôs for sure. Yet it took 4 minutes to pull down just one episode on [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) [AMZN **0.31%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN?mod=chiclets)Prime Video. Download time can depend as much on the service you‚Äôre using as it does the speed of your network.

Plus, the iPhone 12 got uncomfortably warm during those downloads. To the point where I had to put it down.

While video streaming and FaceTime HD also looked clearer with 5G, its best use was sharing the connection with your laptop. You won‚Äôt get phone speeds, but working from my laptop from the stadium, I was able to hit 400 Mbps.

Of course, there‚Äôs a price for this. Literally. Verizon required me to upgrade to a top unlimited plan to get the UWB service.

And then there‚Äôs the battery drain. Downloading those episodes on Verizon‚Äôs UWB network used 15% of my battery. That‚Äôs why Apple included a Smart Data Mode. Enabled by default, it uses only that high-speed network if it detects you need it.

Most people won‚Äôt be on superfast 5G, and will find the battery life on these phones to be solid. They lasted a full day of fairly heavy use‚Äîthough fell a bit shorter than the iPhone 11, which consistently leaves me with at least 15% before bed time.

A lot of this is just 5G growing pains. The carriers and Apple are betting that as the networks expand, and phones get into more hands, we‚Äôll see apps and services we can‚Äôt yet imagine‚Äîjust as 4G enabled the likes of Uber and Instagram.

If and when that happens, iPhone 12 owners will be ready. In the meantime, they‚Äôll have a pretty great iPhone.",0

"&gt;Snowden didn‚Äôt go to him randomly‚Äîhe went to him because he thought greenwald would be more likely to publish his stuff than most other reporters, since greenwald had a reputation about caring about civil liberties and not being an establishment stooge.

Snowden absolutely went to him randomly. He [happened to read a Greenwald article for Salon that he liked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/edward-snowden-nsa-secrets-glenn-greenwald-laura-poitras). If he hadn't decided to read the news that day, he would likely have selected some other reporter instead.

And it turned out Snowden was wrong about Greenwald being likely to publish his stuff. He went to Greenwald in late 2012 and Greenwald [couldn't even be arsed to speak with him](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html) (let alone do any reporting). Greenwald only got involved after Snowden went to Laura Poitras and Poitras convinced Greenwald that interviewing Snowden was worth the effort.

&gt;Greenwald has done a *lot* of great investigative reporting since, incidentally‚Äîparticularly relating the Brazilian political corruption.

I'm not disputing that Greenwald *was* \- emphasis *was* \- a great reporter. I'm only saying that (i) he lucked out when Snowden reached out to him out of the blue, (ii) he lucked out again when, despite having ignored Snowden, Snowden ended up reaching out to Poitras and Poitras looped him in anyway, and (iii) he's no longer a credible reporter, given how deeply he's dived into shilling Russian propaganda about the [""deep state"" opposing Trump](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/11/the-deep-state-goes-to-war-with-president-elect-using-unverified-claims-as-dems-cheer/) and [demonizing Hillary](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/15/12853236/glenn-greenwald-trump-clinton).

I don't know whether Greenwald's been compromised by the Russians, or if he's just doing this because he's come to personally hate America (not without reason, given the kind of harassment he and his husband have been subjected to at the border due to the U.S. and UK's interventions). But at the very least he's a useful idiot for the Russians, and for Trump.",0

In addition, the steam sauna is closed but the dry sauna is open.  Why is that?  Dry saunas operate at higher temperatures (70-100¬∞C or 158-212¬∞F) and have porous wood furniture that make it difficult for any virus to survive for long.  The CDC publishes guidelines/considerations for operating saunas during coronavirus, so we don‚Äôt have to listen to ignorant people speaking out of their asses.

Safety first! We take health and wellbeing very seriously.  Our Bathhouse has and will continue to be cleaned and sanitized on a strict schedule. All technicians and guest receiving treatments will be required to wear face masks, and can also wear gloves upon request.

Our lobby and locker rooms will be marked with social distance markers. We will be keeping it small with only 16 guests on-premises at once.  Accordingly, guests are kindly asked to adhere to a 2-hour time limit on using the amenities so that we can ensure comfortable capacity at all times. For the time being, only two people, or one group who have come in together, will be allowed in the thermo-neutral and hot pools at a time and only one person at a time in the cold plunge.  Only one party is allowed in each sauna at a time, and the steam room will be closed.‚Äù",0

"UPenn actually tried to [analyze this a bit](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/10/12/covid-trade-offs-in-school-re-opening).

To give a sense of the cost of school closures:

&gt; By October 1, 2020, we project students in grades 1-12 had lost between $43,000 and $57,000, or 4 to 5 percent of their lifetime wage earnings.

Yes, multiple percentage points of future earnings lost. Implying lower government services and a weaker economy.

Their conclusion:

&gt; Based on September‚Äôs cost per COVID case, the threshold to close schools for October (using the high end of educational harm to children) is over 0.355 new expected infections per student.

Note that that is *new* cases. 

Remember: people were catching COVID while unemployed or retired. Some portion of students and teachers would have gotten sick even with 100% remote learning.

So to correctly interpret their analysis and put it into action, one must then ascertain what impact school reopening has had on infection rates.

A number of countries have had schools open and haven't really seen an increase resulting from them. 

Those results may not replicate here, but in theory our government has contract tracing info. They can tell us how things are going in school vs outside of school.

Note that their analysis also intentionally does not take into account things like lost childcare impacting parents, mental health, and a bunch of other things that would increase the cost of remote schooling.",0

"&gt;If they can‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù

New knowledge is built on top of existing knowledge. And it requires work to maintain existing information.

It's well known that summer vacation has an impact on what students retain. Every school year we'd waste time going over existing concepts to recover what we lost before tackling new subjects.

Except now we've lost way more than just a summer vacation's worth of schooling. We have to not only catch up but learn at an even faster rate than before just to catch up to the last class.

From the [OECD paper about schooling and income loss](http://www.oecd.org/education/The-economic-impacts-of-coronavirus-covid-19-learning-losses.pdf):

&gt; Moreover, it is known from many studies (such as 
the analyses of skill development during the summer 
holidays described in the Annex A) that learning is a 
dynamic process that builds on prior learning, so that 
stagnation leads to growing deficits. Closed schools 
not only impart less new knowledge (Oreopoulos 
and Salvanes, 2011[3]), but also mean loss of already 
acquired skills on which further learning could build 
(Kuhfeld et al., 2020[4]).

"There are many reasons why having a car in the city is difficult.

1. The city will trash your car. Be it from pot holes or parallel parking disasters (hello love tap), the city is not kind to cars. This also means leasing is a no go.
2. Cars are expensive. Even buying used, if you have a decent car, you'll be looking at least $5k per year between depreciation, maintenance, gas, insurance, parking/tickets, repairs, oil changes, tire changes, side mirror replacements, etc. If you have an expensive car, first year depreciation alone can hit $20k+. Renting a car for the odd weekend that you need it is \~$200 per.
3. Time is also valuable and spending 40-50 hours per a year looking for parking is a lot of time that might be better spent, I don't know... sleeping? And waiting in your car for parking to become legal can be painful. Tickets are worse though. If you value your free time at $20 per hour it's not cheap.
4. Getting out of the city by car is hell, especially if you're going north and need to go anywhere near the GWB.

Cars are great, I would love to have one, but I've done the math and it's just not in the cards right now. When I'm not wfh I bike to work, I get my groceries locally, and when I need a car I rent one. I have an irresponsible friend that bankrupted herself on a Mercedes SUV. She leased it had to to do extensive repairs, got a ton of tickets, had a ton of stress with alternate side of the street parking. And she drove it for non parking reasons once or twice a month.

Wealth doesn't mean shit. Rich yuppies and hipsters typically don't have wealth because they're too busy blowing their whole paycheck (and borrowing) to fit their lifestyle. Putting them in the same class as poor immigrants is nonsensical. 

On the other hand, Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, are full of lower middle-class homeowners. Those homes might be worth millions now, but they weren't when they were bought, and it doesn't mean their owners have good jobs or spending money.",0

"&gt;BUT NOT BECAUSE it's some great egalitarian transport system for the poor.

No. But but it's certainly better than public transit. Which tends to only be accessible to those rich enough to be able to afford to live in Manhattan or subway stops. 

Cars are cheap everywhere. And allow people to live farther away from transit and get more affordable housing. Those who live in the Bronx, deep Queens, and deep brooklyn, are not rich. Far from it. 

NYC natives are far more likely to own cars than transplants for example. The fetishism for public transit is a rich white transplant thing. 

&gt;Even in those neighborhoods it is a tool for the richer citizens.

If you measure how rich someone is by whether or not they own homes maybe. But fun fact, you don't actually have to be rich to own a home in this country. In fact owning a home makes you solidly middle class. Should middle class people be taxed to hell and back because they dared to aspire to own their own homes in an expensive area?

That's the point of the dog treats, to prove they don't have as much control over their dogs as they think they do, or at least, to provide some incentive for the owners to obey the law.

"My wife is Punjabi. My BIL invited two friends and their families, one of which was a bit of a big deal ‚Äúin the community‚Äù.

It did not work with our 130 person venue in Long Island. His main wedding reception had over 300 people sand it was not considered a big wedding.

Other differences include the mind boggling number of events:

First of all, engagement parties are expected and in my experience can be either a year before  or the week of the wedding. Its called a Saggun and it is the first official meeting of the families.

Then you have the Mendhi, which is typically at the brides family‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs where the bride and women of the family‚Äôs get their henna done. It takes hours. Traditionally it‚Äôs ladies only, but our family has been having them as mostly co-ed catered house parties. 

Next is Jaggo Night. From what I understand, it‚Äôs a party to make noise to let the whole town know there is a wedding. The thing is, I got the invitation. It‚Äôs at a catering hall. It‚Äôs not even the first event. WE KNOW THERES A WEDDING. We flew in for fucks sake. It‚Äôs a reception.

The next event is the Sangeet it‚Äôs another reception. Why? I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not gonna google it. Put on a different Kurta so you don‚Äôt look like a Jaggoff for wearing the same outfit from last night‚Äôs reception.

Next morning you get to go to temple a little hung over for the actual wedding. This can last anywhere from 90 minutes to 8 hours. Meals are served.

"In case anyone can't read past the paywall.

&gt;The New York Police Department is forming an Asian Hate Crime Task Force, its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.

&gt;The city has seen a rise in hate crimes directed at Asian people since the coronavirus pandemic began, the NYPD said. Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages, the group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to prosecution. It will remain after the pandemic, the NYPD said.

&gt;‚ÄúWhen a victim looks at an Asian cop, they‚Äôll see, ‚ÄòOh he reminds me of my brother, or my son,‚Äô‚Äù said Stewart Loo, the NYPD deputy inspector who heads the task force. ‚ÄúIt gives them some comfort level.‚Äù

&gt;The nation‚Äôs largest police department logged 23 incidents of coronavirus hate crimes, a separate category created this year to track crimes targeting someone for their identity based on the perception that it has something to do with Covid-19. All but one targeted New Yorkers of Asian descent.

&gt;Hate crimes overall have plunged in the city, according to NYPD data. There were 206 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and Sept. 27, down 33% compared with 308 in the same period a year ago. Incidents of anti-Semitism, which account for the majority of hate crimes reported in the city, fell 50%.

&gt;Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, commanding officer of NYPD‚Äôs Hate Crime Task Force, said he wasn‚Äôt surprised when crimes rose against Asian people. The origins of the virus in China, he said, would inspire some people to irrationally blame Asian-Americans.

&gt;But what he hadn‚Äôt foreseen was the reluctance of some victims to cooperate with authorities‚Äîsome driven by fear of law enforcement, others by a lack of English proficiency, and still more who worried about their troubles going public, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúThey would not answer our phone call, they would not answer the door for us,‚Äù Mr. Molinari said.

&gt;When he discussed these problems during a virtual town hall with the public, Mr. Loo, a commanding officer at the Manhattan South Detective Bureau, reached out with a proposal: create a team of Asian-American officers to investigate crimes that involve Asian victims or witnesses.

&gt;So far, officers on the task force have been sent out to chat with Asian victims in person, and have successfully convinced some to report crimes, Mr. Loo said. The officers are loaned to the task force as needed, but also have full-time jobs elsewhere in the department.

&gt;Mr. Loo, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a child in 1983, said his father was robbed multiple times working as a delivery man for Chinese restaurants in Manhattan during the 1980s. He would serve as a translator between his dad and the police, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúI was kind of like 8 or 9 years old, trying to translate, trying to get through,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was tough.‚Äù

&gt;Those experiences partly inspired him to join the NYPD in 2000, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúWith Covid and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it‚Äôs a very uncomfortable feeling being out in public,‚Äù he said.

&gt;Coronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city except Staten Island, NYPD data showed. Manhattan has experienced the most, with 13 incidents, followed by five in Brooklyn, three in Queens and two in the Bronx. Arrests have been made in 15 cases.

&gt;In one March incident, the police said, a group of four teenage girls approached a 51-year-old woman on an MTA bus in the Bronx. The teens attacked the woman, made anti-Asian statements and struck her in her head with an umbrella before fleeing the bus. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she received stitches for a laceration to her head.

&gt;Three 15-year-old girls, who were apprehended near the scene a short time after the incident, were arrested and charged with hate-crime assaults, menacing and harassment. One teen wasn‚Äôt apprehended.

&gt;In another case in September, a man on a bicycle began yelling anti-Asian statements at a man and his female companion who were walking on Broadway in Manhattan near Union Square. The man on the bicycle then assaulted the man with his bicycle and his backpack, before fleeing on the bicycle. Nobody was injured, and no arrests were made.

&gt;Alice Wong, chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council in New York City, said many of her friends and family started fearing for their safety after the pandemic hit. Some people blamed Asians for the virus, or would avoid Asian people or businesses out of a misguided fear that they would get Covid-19, she said.

&gt;Ms. Wong, who hasn‚Äôt been the victim of a crime, said she has talked to the NYPD since March to voice her concern about anti-Asian sentiment and crimes and share concerns she hears from others in the community.

&gt;‚ÄúEveryone thought it was a matter of time before someone said something derogatory or someone hurt them or someone said they should go back to their country,‚Äù she said",0

Our building however all have motion sensors so they will turn off lights in areas that don‚Äôt have people working (there are a few people who still come in).  I don‚Äôt understand how keeping HVAC off will promote mould growth, but in buildings with reduced activity, we would then purge our domestic cold water lines at certain times as the lack of flow can increase the chance of legionella.

"I just wish there was a simple way to pay by credit card for deliveries while still avoiding the usual delivery services. If there was a quick way for the delivery person to scan the receipt and then let me tap to pay, I‚Äôd be a very happy customer.",0
Where is the logic in that?,0

I climbed that building once.  Although I used the elevator.,0
I survived no halloween for 2 years with Sandy and that October snowstorm. Kids can survive a year without halloween. Lets not have a virus outbreak over trick-or-treating.,0

Someone reported a cat sleeping on the bread.,0
CUNY also used to be a lot more selective decades ago (prior to the 60‚Äôs). There‚Äôs a reason City College used to the called ‚Äúthe poor mans Harvard‚Äù,0
Yes. Why not?,0
they spelled it right later - so you're just being a jerk huh,0
What happens when you call a grub hub number though? Does it go to the restaurant or to a GH operator? How does GH get paid if you‚Äôre a restaurant that doesn‚Äôt work with them?,0
This looks really good!! Good luck!,0
"I‚Äôm ex-Orthodox and he reminds me of some of the misfits I‚Äôd see around my old synagogues. I wasn‚Äôt Chassidic but gravitated to similarly insular Orthodox groups (Yeshivish/Charedi.) The vast majority of the people in those types of synagogues are what you‚Äôd imagine- wear suits, live a very conservative lifestyle and practice some kind of profession that fits their religious needs. But there‚Äôs often a few people around who are kind of disheveled, often not as observant and often kind of troubled people. It can be from a lot of things. They could‚Äôve been raised Orthodox, lost religion and came back. Drugs or mental illness are often involved. Some are the Jewish equivalent of ‚Äúborn agains‚Äù grabbing onto something like Chabad for social support. These people may still have a cultural identity as ‚ÄúOrthodox‚Äù or ‚ÄúChassidic‚Äù even though they don‚Äôt really fit per se. If that man said he‚Äôs Chassidic, obviously I wouldn‚Äôt put a lot of practical credence in it but it‚Äôs probably true in his own mind.",0
Pretty sure I've seen more nuns do that gesture than any Asian person.,0

"Ok. Did you look at your itemized bill? It's not just WHAT you order but where.

Are Prices on Grubhub and Seamless higher then direct? Sometimes yes, but they usually add 50c to 1$ per item difference. Depending what you're ordering it shouldn't be that big of a difference. 

Does that price difference include a delivery fee? The further away you're ordering from the larger of a delivery fee you're likely to pay. 

Did you also forget to change the automatic tip? When you put in your payment info and go to checkout Grubhub and all the other services have a nasty habit of filling in the tip area for you presuming you're going to tip. They don't let you save a default tip preference or put it zero. So, did you end up paying a large tip?

I can imagine there being a 10$ price difference if you ordered a handful of things but a 22$ difference? I'd actually call and complain and report that to Grubhub. Though the various services tend to look the other way, the Restaurants are not supposed to charge different amounts.

One thing they do that does piss me off is that they recently added an unavoidable service fee hidden in with the taxes on the receipt. Its 1$ on every order and you cannot remove it or discount it or do anything about it. Door Dash and Uber eats are worse adding 11% manditory fee on everything.

I agree with you, order direct when ya can, but i still order through grub hub because most places do not have their own actual website, when they make a mistake they dont give a refund or fix it or a coupon like grubhub does. I like that accountability.",0
Shut the fuck up.,0
A lot of them out where I have lived in Brooklyn do that surcharge for non cash purchases. They almost have to because they are paying through the wazoo for the transactions in fees. They also do not get the best wholesale prices and of course they pass it on. Rents have increased to ridiculous prices too. There are too many. There's such competition it's absurd. Adjacent to my one block we have like 4. I don't know how they stay in business honestly...,0
What age did you stop trick-or-treating? lol,0
Because usually people do not. Take a minute to observe the world around you. You are giving people too much credit.,0
Awesome idea but you gotta move out of New York to be successful. King Cuomo doesn‚Äôt like entrepreneurs.,0
"Make some with different inclusions. These sound amazing but I need a no fruit version!

Good luck out there!",0
"Funny how idiots project. Imagine being a nominee for SCOTUS and not being able to state the five freedoms of the first amendment. Constitutional scholar indeed.

"when I want to order something it should be from a certain restaurant I want to pick not something that is limited by grubhub, not to mention the cost and realizing that some people are willing to mess with your order I'm not taking anymore chances.",0
"Housing Works can be fun to explore, they‚Äôre all over the city. And if you haven‚Äôt been to the east village/ St. Marks yet, that will be, at most, close to the feeling of what you‚Äôre looking for (https://www.villagepreservation.org/2020/07/17/where-hip-vintage-in-nyc-got-its-start-limbo-on-st-marks-place/) 

But yeah, most good stuff is in smaller towns outside the city or on Facebook marketplace. Good luck! Def try and explore a small town outside of NYC if you can.

"This is a half-formed thought, but curious, why do we have to rescue people that decide to climb a building? 


Rescue which entails closing the streets, deploying hundred to police/firefighters, cutting the window of the building, dozens of other usage of time/resource/money.


I could see how you want to deploy people to track him as he/people who climb buildings are usually deranged. Also, deploy authority to arrest him on the roof or on the ground. And make sure people on the ground are safe but closing the streets are a stretch.


Let them do their climbing, track them for public safety and arrest them when they eventually come down or up. But he made the decision to engage in reckless and thoughtless behavior, why spend so much and inconvenience thousands of people to rescue someone who have no consideration for anyone else?


Again, am I missing something here",0
I also got an email to complete a virtual training. Were you able to figure out if we get paid for the online training or do you only get paid for in person training?,0
Yup NYC literally murdered itself over COVID. Worth it. Right?,0
"Yikes. Sorry this is so tedious. 

This is sometimes referred to as a ""mixed voter."" Someone linked, or incorrectly ""matched"" your fiance's registration to another voters record (or vice versa). It's totally fixable, and I'm baffled as to why no one was able to help you.

Every voter record has an image of each form that prompts a change to the record, as well as a cataloged history of changes. I can't tell from your post if your fiance's record was updated with someone else's form; or if your wife's most recent form was incorrectly added to someone else's record... but it's simply a matter of extracting what's wrong and pairing it with the correct record. If you have the confirmation of the address change it seems like another voter was linked to her record since that time?

If this is Manhattan, you're looking for 200 Varick Street, 10 Fl, New York, NY 10014  
/ Tel: 1-212-886-2100

You need to speak to a ""list maintenance"" or ""voter registration"" supervisor; or if that fails you can ask to speak to the Chief or Deputy Chief Clerk of the office.

When early voting starts there will be a NYS supreme court judge at that office each day, as well. They would have access to the voter database and could provide your fiance with a court order to vote in person. Hopefully the Board can address this before then.",0
