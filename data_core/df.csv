I tested positive for antibodies way back in may. I was sick with what I thought was the flu in February. Fast forward to about a month ago - I had swelling in my leg. I thought I pulled a muscle or something. I finally went to urgent care when it became unbearable and they sent me to the ER. I had a blood clot in my leg and it travelled to my lungs. Doc still doesn‚Äôt know what caused it but they suspect it‚Äôs complications from covid as there is no other explanation. I was in critical condition in the ICU. I was in the hospital for four days. I‚Äôm out now and on blood thinners (prob for the rest of my life) and unsure of my fate as there are still clots in my lungs.

"Checking in on people's thoughts of NY1 in 2020. It is not the local news network it was in the 1990s. And is it just me, or is the network giving too much attention to right wing talking points? Last week, Trump falsely claimed that the vaccine was coming this week, and NY1 reported it as fact. Stenography is not journalism. And today, they have a story on the anti-Cuomo protest outside of Mac's pub in Richmond County. That's way too much attention to the fringe. And of course Charter/Spectrum is just an evil corporation. They are supporting the packing of the FCC with Trump appointees who will remain through Biden's first term. And of course we have the [ongoing age and gender discrimination suit led by Shaughnessy and Lee](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3az8p9/they-shun-us-in-the-newsroom-ny1-women-who-sued-for-discrimination-say-theyre-facing-retaliation). Pat Kiernan is more of a conservative than we knew. And Jamie just sucks. So we're left with Wills, the night crew, Adame, Anika, Shaughnessy and Lee.   


My question is - has anyone been able to quit NY1? As charming as In The Papers is, can you still watch a news channel that isn't rally news anymore? Thanks for reading my rant.",0
"We recognize the impact of both COVID-19 and COVID restrictions on our community and that discussion about both things is relevant to the subreddit. That said, we do not want to interfere with lifesaving public health measures during a pandemic and we are not a science- or medicine-related subreddit. To that end, we have instituted the following rules:

COVID can be talked about in the following ways and others:

*    How COVID or COVID measures impact you personally
*    What COVID rules are and how they have changed
*    NYC related COVID news or personal experiences
*    Whether shutdowns are timely and/or otherwise sufficient
*    What specific masks to use and how to safely travel around the city

Examples of comments we will not tolerate:

*    Whether masks or social distancing are necessary (or effective)
*    Whether the COVID pandemic is really a public health threat
*    Conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, about public health measures, or about vaccines
*    Advocating noncompliance with public health guidelines or shaming others for folowing them

These lists are incomplete and moderators will use our best judgement.

You may not agree with these guidelines as these issues are important to all of us in NYC, but we are not a science subreddit and we cannot police the spread of misinformation and inappropriately interpreted scientific literature on a fine scale.

"Hi All,

So, I think I screwed up and looked at an apartment (and applied) for something I \*thought\* was a no-fee apt, but I'm now realizing the apartment that was listed online is not actually the apartment they showed me (same line, different place). I can't even find THAT apartment on StreetEasy... 

Does anyone know what's happening with broker fees right now? In this case, the broker has a relationship with the landlord and I think might actually help me instead of just pushing paperwork around, but I really am going to have trouble shelling it out.  I've gotten lucky and never had to pay a broker fee before. I know REBNY challenged the ""landlord pays the fee"" back before COVID and, as far as I know, it's still tied up in court so... broker fees stand. Can you negotiate a fee down to 1 month's rent? Less?

Also, can you pay broker fees with credit cards or anything else like that? I just don't have the cash lying around to throw at a broker right now.  Has anybody gone through this recently?

Thanks much for any advice!",0

"1 more month of 2020 left. March seems so far and near at the same time. Been a hectic year, people moved out of the city/ into the city, switched to remote work/school. 


With the year coming to an end what are people's reflection on life and (tentative) plans for 2021?


For those that moved out of the city for whatever reason*:


What are your housing plans for the first few months of 2021? When do you plan on returning to NYC (if at all, and if not, why not)? What were the variables motivating your decision to return to NYC or not?


*With millions of people, sure there are a many reasons why people moved out, whether it is due to losing their job, saving money in a lower cost place, staying with family etc. We've all read threads that turn into heated arguments about ""true New Yorkers"" and non-constructive finger pointing about ""leaving."" Let's keep away from that.


For those that moved into the city:


How have you been liking/or not liking it so far?


Work/School:


Any updates on your companies/school return to work/office/school?


I hear most university are still sticking with the online classes for the Spring 2021 semester.

"**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* *What's the difference between pop up sites, hospitals, mobile sites, self swabbing sites and point of care? -* Different sites will ask for varying levels of information and offer different tests. Not all rules apply to all sites but generally you can expect mobile sites to be quicker, outdoors, with no insurance information collected but these do not offer antibody testing or rapid testing. Pop up sites can be distinguished by the temporary trailers in a fixed location and will ask for insurance (but it's not needed). Some offer rapid testing and flu shots. Point of care are any of the above sites or its own entity offering rapid testing and results in the same visit. Self-swabbing sites are sites where you register to use a kit that comes with the items needed to swab oneself - better for those who are computer literate.
* *What are turn around times?* \- 1-3 days, not 24-72 hours. What this means is for most sites it doesn't matter if you comes at 9 am or 4 pm because specimens are processed at the end of the day. 
* *Where will you be?* Please look online at [nyc.gov/covidtest](https://nyc.gov/covidtest). Look out for mobile sites or pop up sites or NYC H+H designated locations.
* *What are the lines like*? - Depends on the site. You should expect sites closer to the city to have longer lines. If you have a car driving to another site could be quicker. 
* *What do I need to bring?* All testing should be free and you will not be turned away due to lack of insurance. If you have it please bring your insurance information to stationary sites - mobile sites don't collect",0

I've been wanting to move to NYC for the past few years, and I finally got an opportunity to do so.

"I‚Äôm asking this in NYC subreddit versus finance since I‚Äôm wanting to know what applies specifically to NYC and with so many being small biz owners or self employed, I figured I‚Äôd find the answer.

When purchasing a family home.. say it‚Äôs a 2 level home with a finished basement. It‚Äôs listed as being 1300 sq feet but the basement is ALSO 650 sq feet meaning it totals 1950 sq ft.. if your mortgage (principal/interest), property tax come to $2,800 a month ‚Äî or ‚Äî including all utilities and maintenance we are talking a $4,100 a month .. and you use 90% of the basement for your business entirely (my business is product based so this is realistic.. and I‚Äôd have a corner for the washer dryer).. you‚Äôd be using 30% of the square footage of your house (585 sq feet .. all 3 floors of house are 1950 sq feet so that‚Äôs 30%)

From what I‚Äôve read, for the most part it‚Äôs usually ideal to take the standard deduction of $5 per square foot for 300 sq feet which is $1500 (so that‚Äôs an $18,000 deduction right)?  (If we did it based on 30% of $4100 a month.. that‚Äôs $1230.. so it seems more ideal to take the standard deduction)

What I want to ask is, in your experience if the bottom level of the home is a basement or a garage that was converted to a living space does this count in the overall square footage of the house and is it able to be deducted as so? 

Finished basements and converted garages are more of a thing here so thought I‚Äôd ask. Whenever I see real estate listings I‚Äôll see .. for instance.. a house is listed at 1000 sq feet when there‚Äôs also a 500 sq ft basement below..

"Hello! This may be a shot in the dark, but I have a ny ebt question.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using HRA EBT for several months now (I believe since September or October) as I am a recent graduate as of September 2020 and receive no unemployment because I was only previously an unpaid intern (which is exceptionally bs, but what else would you expect). 

&amp;#x200B;

My account says ""no upcoming payments"" on the Access HRA app. I received my last food stamp and cash assistance payment on November 7th. I believe my food stamp benefits are up for recertification, which I've done. My cash assistance says plainly that I am not due for recertification. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering why my account says there are no upcoming payments? I have tried to get a grasp on this ridiculous process, but I'm still learning.

Thanks!",0

The reason being is that I am leaving my job at the end of the month and my commuter benefits will be totally wiped when I leave. Due to COVID-19 I haven't needed to use them at all since March so I've accrued too much to use in three weeks. Any advice or hearsay would be appreciated!",0

"My entire apartment building and the one across from me has a roach infestation and management is trying their best to make sure nobody knows. I contacted them several times saying we found big roaches in our apartment. I took steps to protect our unit but the battle is lost if they don't find the source and deal with it. They spray compactor rooms...whoopie...the roaches in compactor rooms are an effect of the infestation

So, tonight after printing out many many letters and using half my black ink cartridge describing the roach problem and telling tenants to call management to deal with it I am preparing to go out into the hallways and deliver each letter to every tenant. 

LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN. MANAGEMENT DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW? GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM ALL

On the letter I encourage them to contact 311 and the housing development and preservation department if management continues to not take this seriously.

I'm so excited! It's clobbering time!!!",0

We just moved to NYC and have a 1 year old that we would like to take to daycare.

We are not looking for a full time program, we just want our son to socialize with other kids, learn English (we speak Spanish at home) and get us some adult time. 2-3 days a week for 4-5 hours each day should be fine.

I did some search on the internet and I find all daycare is extremely expensive (over 2000/month) and I didn't see any part time or drop-in options.

What are our options here? Are there any options for us that we haven't thought about?

"So I'm a Canadian who really likes NYC, because it isn't that far away, I can get around no problem, enjoy the restaurants, Central Park, other attractions, etc.

Obviously this question is for a post-Covid scenario.

Each time I've been in NYC, I've stayed in the UWS, either with a friend, or in a nice condo that I rent on occasion. I like the UWS, but is there another area in a different borough that someone could recommend?

The Pros of staying in the UWS are its familiarity (almost feels like coming home to visit an old friend, in a good way), proximity to transit, within walking distance to some great areas in Manhattan.

The Con is, I've seen much of the city south of 90th, and should probably give the other boroughs a chance (or other areas of Manhattan).

Any suggestions?",0

Has anybody else ever used those, or something else? If so, what are your thoughts? Is it worth it?

I always call 311 so that they can send an officer to ticket the vehicle but they never come. The few instances when they do come, it's always takes them around three to five hours. I don't understand what is the point of us having to call 311 to get a car ticketed in order for it to be towed when the police in this city don't do anything when it comes to non emergency calls. In my opinion that law needs to be abolished and homeowners so be free to call a towing company once he or she witnesses their driveway being blocked.",0

"As the title says, I am looking into terminating my lease in Manhattan for a few reasons but mainly a broken radiator whose excessive noise keeps me up at night. I signed a 13 month lease (13th month free) starting October 1st. The real estate agent (outside firm) told me verbally that the only penalty for breaking the lease is losing your security deposit (1 month's rent) and I'm kicking myself that I didn't get that in writing, but it may still stand as she didn't seem shady.

This is the third night in less than two months that the banging noise on the steam pipe that runs floor to ceiling and radiator will keep me up the entirety of the night. It sometimes happens in the day too, it's extremely loud and hard to even be in the unit awake the volume is so disturbing. Almost every time I have contacted the super via text and he has said for over a month now that the feeder, etc. is broken so it's just happening. He also admitted that many other tenants in the 35 unit building have been complaining. He just seems completely over the problem and is in general rude and doesn't always reply. I spoke to the property management's ""construction manager"" about 2.5 weeks ago and he seemed hardly aware of the problem. They're dragging their feet and the noise violates the warranty of habitability for this unit, not to mention that the heat level is extremely excessive in my unit.

Another big issue I have had is they have turned off the water 4 times this month, twice without notice. When it happened the first time the construction manager was apologetic and said he would follow up with the super since it was obviously not okay. The second time was today and I called and spoke to the property manager for the first time who was extremely hostile and told me to just wait it out and that it was probably an emergency and perfectly legal. His demeanor on the phone was so aggressive and threatening that I refused to identify myself by name.

Smaller problems include a hole in the ceiling where the steam pipe runs through. They patched this up once but it continues to drop debris crack further into the room. Not to mention is is an exposed hole. I have seen roaches and mice on the 2nd, 1st and basement levels. I see mice every time I am in the basement for laundry/trash. Thankfully not in my unit but I have seen on 311 other tenants complain of pests in their units. I haven't addressed the pest problem with management as there are multiple 311 complaints out already.

I'm hoping for advice on next steps. I have the service requests and almost all interactions with the super in writing. I really don't think I can make it another 11 months, especially through the winter with this noise problem at night. I also work from home and the noise interrupts my workday/calls. I don't want to have to go to housing court but I really want to get out of this lease ASAP and I'm frankly scared of engaging in a battle as the property owner is a real estate lawyer and all of the other employees have made the whole operation seem like a full blown slumlord operation.

"So I found this absolutely amazing apartment that I fell in love with the moment I stepped inside. I told the broker/real estate agent that I would like to apply for the place, and he said in order to move forward, I have to submit a ""good faith deposit"" of a few hundred to take the apartment off the market and on hold as they start the next part of processing my application. If my application isn't approved, they will send the deposit back. They also said that the money put into the deposit will go into my security deposit once I sign the lease.

This all sounds fine to me, and I really would like to sign for this apartment. However, one of my friends claims that this is illegal and they aren't allowed to ask for money in this way. Yet there's no broker fee and the security deposit is one month's rent (which I know NYC made a law stating that a security deposit cannot be more than one month's rent). Is he right and it's illegal, or am I good to go?

"Hello, first time posting here. I have an idea that I wanted to throw into the wild concerning rat extermination, a persistent issue in NYC.

I'm aware of some creative methods that are used to exterminate rodents in the city. I'm not aware if this idea has been floating around but what about neutering  the rats that was caught and send them back to their habitat. Both male  and female, rats aren't choosy. This increases the rate of unsuccessful  fertilization within the rodents' population, hence declining their  birth rate.

I  argue that this is better than poisoning or killing because those methods  would select stronger rats to procreate which would strengthen the  future rodent population within the city. Together with better sanitation standard from both officials and the people, and various other methods, this might significantly reduce the rats population in the city.

Now for the cons of this idea is that rats are hard to catch let alone being caught alive. So the alternative to this method is to introduce sterile rats that was bred by human into the wild. The sterilization might be done after birth or genetically. Of course this may post other unforeseen trappings, pun intended, feel free to express those thoughts. 

Also I'm aware that both low sanitation standard and the structure of our sewage system throughout history among various other reasons lend itself to be a prime location for rats' habitats.",0

"Hey guys, just some background info. I've lived in the New Jersey suburbs my whole life. I'm a senior in high school and I plan on most likely working in the city after I graduate college with a Computer Science degree. I visited the city yesterday for the first time in years. I was excited and expected to enjoy my time there but I don't believe I got a good impression of it. 

I was driving on the streets for the first time and the traffic there is definitely insane. I managed to get where I wanted to go but it was a nightmare trying to get by. People constantly walking through the streets on red lights, people parking in the middle of the streets, and I saw a crackhead just walking through an active street. When I ended up parking my car, I noticed there were a lot of homeless people as well as their ""beds"". Lots of areas where I went to had a heavy stench of marijuana  (I just really can't stand the smell) and I started getting irritated a lot hearing cars constantly beeping at each other. I have no idea how you guys are able to sleep through the night with all the noise haha.

However, there were some positives. The food is actually really good and there are so many places you can visit in such a small area. The buildings were also absolutely stunning to look at and there's so much detail everywhere. 

Perhaps I got a bad first impression but I guess I'd like to hear from you guys who've lived in NYC your whole life what you like and dislike about it. Also any tips/places I should visit when I visit there next time.

I hope post doesn't make me sound like a negative person or anything. I've been to other cities and loved them but I just didn't enjoy NYC as much as I expected.",0

* How have COVID-19 regulations affected your commute?

"Hey NYC community -- 

I'm hoping someone in this Reddit can steer me toward volunteer opportunities in the city that would be available over the next few months. I've done some Googling but a lot of the resources online are dated to before the pandemic, so they don't account for healthy behaviors or consider the way NYC has changed since March. 

Some context: I've never volunteered before. I am dissatisfied with the selfish mindset that seems so pervasive in our country, and even more tired of my own complaining about it. I'd like to engage with members of the NYC community who need help (safely, of course) and try to make a positive difference in the world. 

The immediate ideas that occur to me are helping with community fridges that have popped up to address food insecurity. Or, I'd like to somehow help an envrionmental cause to combat to overwhelming sense of dread over global warming. I am an experienced writer and sometime athlete capable of moving boxes, transporting materials or writing grants, proposals, etc. 

I don't have a car and work remote every day Monday - Friday. 

Any ideas? 

Thank you.",0

"Soooo ...one of my roommates has decided he's had enough and is getting out Dec. 1st.  We live in a 3 bedroom house and the rent is 3100 split 3 ways. He has already contacted the landlord and told him he is leaving. The landlord hasn't gotten in contact with us yet about it. Just wondering what is acceptable in this situation. I'm planning on asking if we can pay 2000 until February first since that's the earliest I forsee someone being able to move in. I'm really trying to avoid having to rush someone in who will not be the right fit. We have lived here 6 years and never been late on rent or asked for anything except a hole in the roof patched.  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this or any input on if this is even an acceptable ask?   All advice is welcome.

We have a new account number.

I don't know why she couldn't have thought of something else to put me on??? Like idk, the internet bill???? She knew that the account number would change and that we would probably lose whatever was giving us $20 electricity bills. Bill came out to $60 this month and she's upset. üôÑüôÑüôÑ

I don‚Äôt go in their way, I focus on where I‚Äôm headed but they always come up to me. I‚Äôm not sure what this guy mutters as I can‚Äôt hear him well. He has never threatened me or attacked me. I mostly see him hanging around with a big bag and eating something. I asked my bf who he is and he doesn‚Äôt think the man lives in the building. He says the man hangs there a lot but wouldn‚Äôt ever harm someone. But he says the homeless man may be schizophrenic or bipolar or has something else. My bf always walks downstairs with me when I‚Äôm headed to my car after visiting him, but I don‚Äôt ask him to walk with me when I am going to his place as I don‚Äôt want to seem too paranoid.

Many times, especially in residential neighborhoods and at night, the bicyclists are delivery drivers and they are more likely to be missing high-visibility gear.

I know wait times are probably longer than they were 3 weeks ago but the way NYC Health + Hospitals is set up is much more efficient and you don‚Äôt have to wait for non-testing visits before you. You don‚Äôt have to explain why you are getting tested either. The only issue is that most of the NYC Health + Hospital locations do not have the rapid testing.

"Hi guys, I posted this in /r/Queens and it seemed to have helped some families so I'm reaching out to other subreddits as well. Hope you guys don't mind.

I work with the city via Department of Health to provide Early Intervention services for children under 3 years old. It has come to our attention that this service is extremely underutilized in the city, so I would like more people be aware of this program.

Early Intervention is a family centered program designed to enhance the capacities of families to meet their child‚Äôs needs, with services provided in the child‚Äôs natural environment. For example, if a child is not meeting their speech milestones, then they would receive speech therapy up to five times a week. Other therapies include but are not limited to physical therapy, occupational therapy, special instruction, and Applied Behavior Analysis. In order to receive these services, the child must be evaluated by therapist and trained healthcare providers. It‚Äôs important to note that the program comes at no cost to you and is covered completely either by your insurance or by the state. It is also completely confidential and voluntary, so you are free to opt out at any point in the program.

If any of you guys are interested in getting started with Early Intervention, feel free to DM me so I can assist in the referral. As a service coordinator, my role in Early Intervention is to locate and facilitate the services for your family. You can also call 311 and ask for more information there. Additionally, for more information you can go to https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/early-intervention.page. If you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask!

"I'm an NYC DOE middle school teacher, and I wanted to offer my perspective on this. I will admit that there are certain groups of students that in-person learning works better for. These include pre-k students, elementary school students, and our students with severe disabilities (district 75). Yes, people are right when the say a 6 year old should not be sitting on Zoom for 6 hours a day. I get that. 

Additionally, I will admit that schools are not necessarily the vectors of COVID-19 transmission that we thought they would be. I do not believe the numbers surrounding this, though. My school was ""randomly tested"" a couple weeks ago and they had enough staff volunteers that they did not actually have to randomly select anyone. Also, the only students they tested were those on the first floor because that's all they needed for their sample. That's not really ""random.""

But my question is, why are middle and high schools still open? What's the point? Let me tell you what it's like for students in my school. They are in one room all day long with less than 10 students. Some classes have as few as two or three students on some days. They cannot move from their seat. If they want to go to the bathroom, we need to call for an escort. They must wear their masks all day except for lunch. More importantly, especially now that the weather is getting cold, all windows must be kept wide open at all times for ventilation purposes. Students and teachers are miserable on cold days, and it's not getting any warmer. We are walking around freezing in parkas, hats, and gloves. The heat is blasting and it does not make a difference when the wind is whipping through the windows.

In a school of normally 1,000 students, we have approximately 95 on a daily basis. There are more adults in the building than students. I'm not kidding, that's it. Why are we doing this?  What's the point? Can anybody give me a compelling reason that middle and high schools should still be open?",0

"So to keep it pretty short, my wife and I began working for a merchant cash advance company in Brooklyn about a month and a half ago. For the first week everything was going fairly well. Payroll was fine and the work was exactly as anticipated(I'd worked for similar companies).

Payroll was messed up every week after the first, for one reason or another. It was always blamed on one of the partners. So our boss would Zelle or Venmo us our pay.

We were given W9s to sign, which I believe is for independent contractors. After reading about the difference between being a contractor and an employee, I discovered that regardless of whether we had filled out a W9 or not, we were considered employees according to state and city law. We had a set schedule, direct supervision and all equipment was provided for us among other things.

So fast forward to last Monday. My wife and I were going to be a few hours late so we emailed the boss to let him know which is how he told us to go about this. From day 1 he knew and understood that we are living in a shelter and there may be some time where we would be late or not be able to come in due to numerous appointments and other sporadic issues that would come up related to our situation. 

We come into the office a few hours late as we had said we would be and are immediately called outside to talk. He tells us to go home and call him Friday to let him know what we wanted to do.

Now this is a commissioned sales job, but the pay structure gives us a salary every week if you do not hit any commission. $400 is the weekly salary, $150 of which is a draw against future commissions. So at this point we are owed for 3 full days of work each, which should be $480 by his pay structure, if it were minimum wage it would be $720, but that's later.

Friday comes around and i text him to ask about payroll and our future and i am told we were terminated and no money is owed to us because we owe the company $600 each for the draw for the month we worked. I email him what I could find about commission work in NYC and it says the draw is to be taken only from future commissions and that its discrimination to fire us because of our housing status.

Once he sees that by firing us for being late would mean that we worked a set schedule and would be considered employees, he concocted some story(told to me by a friend that still works there) about my wife contacting his wife to tell her that he was cheating on her with numerous other women and that is why we were fired.

Is there any way I can get the money that is owed to us? I know that he is breaking all sorts of laws with the business besides just labor law. Dragging my wife into this situation is uncalled for.

One New York City police officer was accused of pepper-spraying a woman, then denying her medical treatment while she was handcuffed in a Bronx holding cell.

Another officer slammed a 51-year-old man who had been arguing with some restaurant workers onto the floor, knocking him unconscious, the man said. A third officer was accused of tackling a gay man during a pride parade and using a homophobic slur.

The city‚Äôs independent oversight agency that investigates police misconduct found enough evidence in all three cases to conclude that the officers should face the most severe discipline available, including suspension or dismissal from the force.

But in the end, senior police officials downgraded or outright rejected those charges, and the officers were given lesser punishments or none at all ‚Äî the kind of routine outcome that has left the Police Department facing a crisis of trust in its ability to discipline its own.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very raw thing,‚Äù recalled Zakariyya Amin, who said he was left deeply disillusioned by how the Police Department handled his case involving the incident in the restaurant. ‚ÄúI wake up, still seeing this guy throwing me around, pushing me around.‚Äù

This pattern of lenient punishment holds true for about 71 percent of the 6,900 misconduct charges over the last two decades in which the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, recommended the highest level of discipline and a final outcome was recorded, according to an analysis of recently released data by The New York Times.

In case after case, the records show that the Police Department often used its power over the disciplinary process to nullify the review board‚Äôs determination that serious misconduct had occurred and that the stiffest punishment should be meted out.

The department regularly ignored the board‚Äôs recommendations, overruled them or downgraded the punishments, even when police officials confirmed that the officers had violated department regulations, The Times found. All the while, the city paid millions of dollars to resolve lawsuits from people filing complaints in some of those very same cases.

Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a platform that included reining in police misconduct, but these trends have gone largely unchanged during his stewardship of the department.

The analysis shows that since Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014, the department has overruled the board‚Äôs recommendation in more than half of the cases in which the board sought the most severe discipline.

In the first half of 2019, the police commissioner at the time, James P. O‚ÄôNeill, imposed the penalty recommended by the review board in just three out of the 14 cases the panel prosecuted.

In one of the remaining cases, the Police Department decided to allow an officer to go unpunished after the review board concluded that he had used excessive force in punching a 14-year-old boy. In another case, the department chose not to take action against an officer found to have used a chokehold to lift a handcuffed man off his feet and slam him into a car.

The release of the Civilian Complaint Review Board records comes as police departments across the country are under mounting pressure to remove problematic officers from their forces after the death of George Floyd.

As protests swept the city and nation this summer, both Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea urged the public to have confidence in the city‚Äôs ability to hold officers accountable. But the data offers further evidence of the challenges that outside oversight agencies face in going up against police forces.

Mr. Shea, who was appointed a year ago, has imposed the board‚Äôs recommended penalty in only two of the 28 cases in which charges were brought, records show.

After learning that The Times had inquired about how Mr. Shea has handled misconduct, the Police Department issued a news release last week promoting his record on discipline. It said that under Mr. Shea, the department had made several changes, including adopting disciplinary guidelines that standardize penalties.

‚ÄúWe ask for the public‚Äôs trust ‚Äî and the public must know we are worthy of it,‚Äù Mr. Shea said.

Still, the handling of police misconduct cases continues to roil the city government: On Wednesday, four senior officials at the Civilian Complaint Review Board were laid off abruptly.

The agency described the move as a restructuring meant to expand its investigative muscle, but some employees said the layoffs amounted to retaliation against officials who criticized how the agency responds when the Police Department refuses to cooperate with its inquiries.

A disciplinary system in ‚Äúdisarray‚Äù

The Civilian Complaint Review Board was established in 1993 by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council to address widespread complaints that police officers were operating with impunity, rarely facing consequences for harassment and brutality, particularly in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Residents who believed that they had been subjected to misconduct often felt they had no recourse, which led to a growing resentment of the police.

The Dinkins administration envisioned that the board would be independent of the Police Department, with its own investigators and subpoena power, and would give the public confidence that abusive officers would be held accountable.

But the data, released for the first time in the agency‚Äôs history, instead suggests that the board has become all but toothless. The public can file complaints, but the board, often referred to as the C.C.R.B., has little ability to ensure that officers deemed troublesome or worse will face serious consequences.

‚ÄúWhat is the C.C.R.B. there for, if they‚Äôre recommending stuff and the N.Y.P.D.‚Äôs not listening?‚Äù said Jacob Alejandro, the gay man who said a lieutenant had knocked him to the ground during a Gay Pride parade, in 2014.

The Police Department declined to comment on the instances of misconduct described in this article, citing an ongoing lawsuit challenging the city‚Äôs authority to release additional records. The department would not make individual officers cited in the complaints available to be interviewed.

Assistant Chief Matthew V. Pontillo, who oversees disciplinary policies, disputed the Times analysis and said it was difficult to draw conclusions from the released data.

There were ‚Äúunique factors that make each case different, that you don‚Äôt see in the data, that you would only see if you read the trial decisions,‚Äù he said.

But the Rev. Fred Davie, chairman of the review board, said the Police Department‚Äôs internal disciplinary system had been in ‚Äúdisarray‚Äù for years.

The review board investigates civilian complaints that allege that officers used excessive force, abused their authority or used offensive language and gestures. And in recent years, the panel gained the power to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and false statements by officers.

The board has no power to impose discipline itself and must present its evidence to an administrative judge employed by the Police Department.

Neither does the board have the power to bring criminal charges. That remains the job of state and federal prosecutors, who are empowered to investigate crimes by officers, such as corruption, assault or unjustified killings.

Just 7 officers facing charges were fired

Since 2015, the review board has published statistics in its annual report showing that the Police Department chose not to follow its recommendations in most cases in which the board brought charges.

But with rare exceptions, the names of officers and other details remained secret until this year, when the State Legislature, responding to the nationwide protests against police brutality, repealed a law that had sealed police disciplinary records.

As a result, the review board released a database of civilian complaints that identifies officers and lists allegations against them, as well as the outcomes of cases.

The data is not comprehensive, especially for complaints filed before 2001. What‚Äôs more, information about people who filed complaints, as well as about pending cases, remains largely secret. The Times was able to determine details of cases through other means, including by reviewing lawsuits.

The data provide the most detailed portrait to date of allegations of serious police misconduct resulting in charges since 2001. Some of The Times‚Äôs findings include:

The Police Department followed the review board‚Äôs recommendations less than 20 percent of the time.

The review board brought charges against a total of 3,188 police officers. Some faced multiple charges in connection with one or more complaints.

798 of the officers were eventually put back onto the street by the department after receiving additional instructions, training or warnings; 890 were not disciplined at all.

Fewer than one in five officers received punishments, ranging in severity from one lost vacation day to 12 months of ‚Äúdismissal probation,‚Äù which allows officers found to have committed offenses they could be fired for, like using a chokehold, to keep their jobs as long as they stay out of trouble.

Just seven officers facing charges were fired, and only after being convicted of a crime in state or federal court or after lying to police internal affairs investigators. They include Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who did not tell investigators the truth about his use of a banned chokehold that sent Eric Garner into a death spiral on a Staten Island sidewalk in 2014.

Some officers had multiple findings against them and continued to rise in the department. The city has paid out more than half a billion dollars just since 2016 to resolve lawsuits over these allegations and many like them.

The board is considered to be so weak that some lawyers said they discouraged their clients from filing a complaint. The lack of a finding or punishment against the police officers involved could be used to undercut a lawsuit.

Body-slammed by a police officer

Mr. Amin, who said he was body-slammed by a police officer in 2012, received just that advice from his lawyer.

Zakariyya Amin said he was body-slammed by a police officer in 2012.

‚ÄúHe said that, ‚ÄòAll you‚Äôre going to be doing is wasting your time,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Amin recalled. He proceeded anyway.

Mr. Amin, then 51, said he had been trying to buy a meal for a homeless man at a Coney Island restaurant when he got into an argument with workers, who refused to serve the other man.

According to the complaint, police officers arrived and accused Mr. Amin of disorderly conduct, twisted his arm behind his back, threw him to the ground and briefly knocked him unconscious.

The review board identified the officer as Andrew Schmitt and, based on its investigation, recommended that the department charge him with using excessive force.

But an administrative judge in the Police Department found Officer Schmitt not guilty of the charge after a departmental trial. The city later settled a lawsuit with Mr. Amin for $150,001.

Pepper-sprayed in a holding cell

Priscilla Colon was 50 when she watched police officers arrest a friend of hers on a street corner in the Bronx in 2009. According to her lawsuit, she was handcuffed after asking why her friend was being detained.

Later, in a holding cell at a Bronx precinct, Officer Kevin Carney pepper-sprayed Ms. Colon and told her to ‚Äúfellate‚Äù him, according to court documents.

The C.C.R.B. recommended Officer Carney be brought up on charges of excessive force for his use of pepper spray and abuse of authority for refusing to seek medical attention for Ms. Colon.

He was not disciplined on the force charge. For abuse of authority, the records indicate he was given command discipline, meaning his punishment was decided by his commanding officer.

It is not clear what sanction he received, but at the time, the penalty for command discipline ranged from a verbal warning to 10 lost vacation days. The city later settled a lawsuit and paid Ms. Colon $50,000.

In some cases, the records appear to show the police upholding the review board‚Äôs findings. But in reality, the penalty imposed by the commissioner was still less than the one that the review board requested.

For instance, the review board wanted Officer James Frascatore to forfeit 10 vacation days for tackling James Blake, a prominent retired professional tennis player, in a case of mistaken identity that received significant attention in 2015.

The officer was found guilty at an administrative trial of using unnecessary physical force, but Police Commissioner O‚ÄôNeill cut the penalty to five days.

In 2017, a Bronx sergeant used a Taser stun gun on a pregnant 17-year-old girl who refused to allow officers responding to a call about an argument to enter her family‚Äôs apartment, according to video and court papers.

The department‚Äôs policy says the devices should not be used on ‚Äúobviously pregnant women,‚Äù but a witness recorded the officer using it on the girl, Dailene Rosario, who screamed she was pregnant as several officers attempted to restrain her.

The sergeant, Robert Durst, pleaded guilty to charges brought by the review board and agreed to forfeit 25 vacation days. But Mr. O‚ÄôNeill docked him just 15. The city later paid $250,000 to settle Ms. Rosario‚Äôs lawsuit.

Scott Rynecki, who represented the teenager, said the evidence could not have been clearer ‚Äî and yet, the officer received a penalty that was hardly enough to deter brutal misconduct, a pattern he has seen with other clients.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not exactly sending them a message not to do this again by hitting them with such minimal penalties,‚Äù he said. The system ‚Äòstill needs a lot of work‚Äô

Assistant Chief Pontillo, who helps to develop disciplinary policies, said one reason the two agencies seldom agreed was that the review board‚Äôs investigations were uneven.

When the Police Department declined to follow the panel‚Äôs recommendations, he said, it was often because the review board had overcharged an officer, failed to produce enough evidence or did not take into account all the circumstances.

He said the department was more likely to follow the board‚Äôs recommendations when it recommended lesser discipline, partly because harsher discipline could hinder police officers‚Äô careers.

‚ÄúThe mere fact of having a substantiated civilian complaint, that can be more significant than any penalty actually imposed,‚Äù Chief Pontillo said.

Andrew C. Quinn, a lawyer who defends police sergeants in misconduct and criminal cases, said he had not been impressed with the review board‚Äôs evidence gathering.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a feel-good agency to say, ‚ÄòHey, look, we‚Äôve got some oversight of the department, a bunch of politically appointed board members and a bunch of inexperienced and incompetent investigators,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

Mr. Davie, the board chairman, acknowledged that the board could improve the quality of some of its investigations but said the Police Department could also do a better job at punishing officers.

The department‚Äôs system has long been haphazard and too dependent on the whim of senior police officials, he said. For those reasons, the department recently proposed a disciplinary matrix to standardize penalties.

‚ÄúThe system was nowhere close to what it needed to be, and it still needs a lot of work,‚Äù he said.

The release of the records has renewed a long-running debate about whether the police commissioner should have sole authority over officer discipline and whether the review board should be able to overrule him.

Chief Pontillo said the commissioner‚Äôs authority is crucial for maintaining control of the force, but Mr. Davie said the entire trial process should be scrutinized.

Civil rights lawyers, elected officials and community activists agreed, saying the department‚Äôs willingness to depart from the review board‚Äôs findings has weakened civilian oversight.

‚ÄúThe N.Y.P.D. has been looking the other way and condoning police abuse routinely and stunningly for decades,‚Äù said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed a public records request to get the data and make it public. ‚ÄúBut I think nobody had any idea how massive and pervasive the failures of accountability were.‚Äù",0

Basically the title. I live in a 3br apartment in a 6 unit building in Brooklyn. Our bill is usually between $30-$80 depending on A/C use and such. Just went in to pay my bill this month and surprised to see that my non-estimated meter reading came out to 45,117 kWh hours. 

The smart meter was installed a couple weeks back and I suspect this is the issue, however I don't understand how to read it (it cycles through multiple settings, one that says 888888 and ""CLOSED,"" another with 21210 - which all the other apartment meters also showed, and then two other settings showing 0.08 and 0.09 with 50 and 60 kWh).

Two days ago, a user posted another call out thread requesting a specific mod be removed from power - https://old.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jsn9g3/another_month_another_thread_about_removing_uqadm/. 

I can no longer access the message because I'm not a moderator any more, but a modmail was sent to us from the mod called out in that thread asking why no one deleted it and how upset he was about it. I made this response: https://imgur.com/a/Srm8VaH 

It doesn't look like anyone else responded that I can tell. 

Then this evening, somehow every mod added after that specific mod was removed. It seems like because we weren't aggressive enough in banning and removing the thread, we were removed from the subreddit, but that's speculative. All mods he could remove - except for the bot mod - were removed. 

So I guess - sorry we nuked the COVID thread because the lack of active participation from the mod in question means you're not likely to get attention. I'd place bets that the election thread is still up in January.

"Hello everyone. I am a new teacher at a Title 1 school district. Over 86% of my students are from low-income households. My 9-10 year old students experience poverty, hardship, distress, and more at such a young age. Their motivation to learn is very tender because they are often discouraged due to their environment.

I see my students for who they are and what they are capable of. My number one goal with my current (and future) students is to ensure literacy. My teacher salary is not enough to afford a classroom library. I make just above the poverty line. The best solution to ensure they have access to thousands of books is with technology. Technology will allow students to receive diverse and relevant reading material that can also meet ALL students at their current reading ability.

Please, if you are capable of donating $1-5 dollars to this campaign it would mean the world to my students and their teacher (me). This is just the difference of getting a grande instead of a venti at Starbucks. Any help counts and I am not asking for much. I just need help reaching this goal and I will scour to the end of the Earth collecting dollars at a time.  **Donors Choose will also double any donations for the next day using code ""LIFTOFF"".** Your $5 donation could become $10 using this code.

Today is World Kindness Day. My students begin each day with social and emotional learning through our morning meeting. I would love to tell them the news that people believe in their education and we received the funds to get an iPad for our classroom. Thank you so much for your consideration. - Ms. Morgan

"My family owns a two family home in NYC. We rent the downstairs apartment and live in the upstairs unit. At the beginning of the year, there were 3 tenants in the rental and everything was fine until Covid hit. We tried to be flex with everyone, offering very low rent or passes on non payment due to the pandemic. Ultimately 2 of the renters moved out and the one remaining person filled the rooms with subletters. Fast forward to a few months later, my husband and I found out we are pregnant with twins and have decided to not renew the tenant lease. We gave ample notice to the person on the lease and she insisted that she would tell the subletters closer to the end of the lease which would be 2 months out. \*\*As a sidenote, she has temporarily moved out of the city so she has not been here and so its only been the subletters residing in the house\*\* The subletters have since been informed that we arent renewing and we are now having an issue with the one person paying rent. They havent paid at all for this month and they are not responding to our emails inquiring. We have made offers to work on payment, but they havent acknowledged any of our emails. They are often coming and going from the house, so they are fully still living here. I guess my question is, if they continue to ignore us and not pay, are we legally allowed to tell them that they have to leave at the end of the month? Is it worth it given they will be leaving at the end of the year anyways?

Additionally, is there any way to negotiate working on the show as a producer, or will the PC not want to have me on with a full time position?

"As our daily cases and positive percentage continue to rise it'd be nice to have a place where we can get info on new (inevitable) restrictions and testing info.

"(Reuters) - Mental health and crisis workers in New York City will respond to emergency mental health calls instead of law enforcement under a pilot program announced on Tuesday, following months of protests around the country over police brutality.

&amp;#x200B;

The program, slated to begin in February, will be composed of new mental health teams from the Fire Department‚Äôs Emergency Medical Services unit and will target two ‚Äúhigh-need‚Äù neighborhoods, which were not identified.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFor the first time in our city‚Äôs history, health responders will be the default responders for a person in crisis, making sure those struggling with mental illness receive the help they need,‚Äù Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.

"Most of it's in the title. We're in a strongly unique position to prevent a second wave, with how easily we can get tests around the city! Make some time within your week to get tested! You can even make it a lunch date with your roommates or something.  

Hospitals are far quicker to test in all aspects than your local clinic. It's definitely worth the trip for the extra reliability, at-venue wait time, and result turnaround time. 

If you go to a clinic, chances are you'll get caught waiting as well for well/unwell visits to go by. You'll also be holding up well/unwell visits, which I have experienced - UTIs are a total bitch to wait more than half an hour with. However, no real harm done if that's your main choice. 

If you do rapid testing, my personal and unqualified recommendation is that you wear a mask afterwards anyway, given the accuracy rate is about 75%. I'd speculate it's better for knowing if you're immediately contagious. My CityMD said that I'd know within 15-20 minutes if I was tested positive, longer if negative. 

Let's snip this shit in the bud! Wear masks! Get tested! Stay socially distanced! Don't forget how god-awful the deaths were back in May. Let's do our best to look out for each other and, at least, ourselves &lt;3",0

"Hello. Sorry to bother. Also sorry if there have been recent posts about this.  

I am a NY resident, but in college out of state. I‚Äôm moving back home and my flight was intended to be later this week. I just saw the new quarantine rules, but the NYS website does not make it abundantly clear what the actual procedure is.  

So, I have to get a COVID test before I leave and I will have to show or present the results before I am allowed into NY?

"Hi 

My name is Fiona, I am a high school teacher, a wife and a mom to a toddler with special needs. I live in NYC and have my entire life. I work in a large Harlem high school. Most of my students receive free and reduced lunch, and many were severely impacted by COVID-19. 

I teach four subjects in highschool (it's a lot). The Spanish class is one of my favorites to teach, but in order to teach it correctly, you must have lots of activities for students to do together and independently to practice Spanish.   In order to help me with all of this planning, I want to buy this curriculum to support them and teach the material in a very clear and concise way. Since I teach four other classes, I find myself prepping worksheets, powerpoints and other remote materials for hours each night. This curriculum pack would lighten my load. 

I plan on buying  ""Spanish One and Two PowerPoints and Curriculum Mega Bundle"" by Angie Torre linked below:

So I am raising money to buy myself four Teachers pay Teachers gift cards of $100 

Please if you can donate just $1-5 dollars. It will help my students get the credit they need, learn the material they need to pass the exam. If you believe in leveling the playing field, and educational equity and opportunity for all, here is your chance to support our kids!

"Over the past year, I'd guesstimate that 30% of the US population suffers from different degrees of mentally illness.  
I used to think that number was much lower and only comprised of the alt-right, but I was saddened to discover that the radical left has an equal weight of mental illness.

Watching spoiled suburban young adults drop thier tiktok filming to go spit on police officers would have been comical if it wasn't so disturbing and annoying.

I lump BLM and the progressive movement into 1... Is it accurate? Maybe not, but that's how it's viewed by the world... I appreciated BLM shinning a light on the flaws of our policing practices and it's obvious to all clear headed individuals that there needs to be improvement. This is not a knock on law enforcement but it cannot be denied that law enforcement exists as a public trust and clearly this trust has been broken between them and the black community. Law enforcement has to own that.

But it's a shame that the BLM movement protests quickly morphed away from police reform and towards an anti-white American protest. So lets keep real and call it what it is.

its time for the progressives to recognize that 70 million Americans didn't vote for Trump because he represents the best and brightest or that they believe this is how a US president should behave, they voted for him b/c they rejected the movement.

The house seats that were lost and half of America voting for Trump are proof that the progressives and BLM are an anchor that will drag our party to the bottom.

To most of the US and the world the movement looked like a bunch of whiny teenagers blind to thier own hypocrisy. Fighting racism with bigotry and not seeing the irony that they were behaving worse then the deplorables they were screaming about. What was truly disgusting were the adults and the information bubbles enabling them.

I joined the democrat party long ago because to me they were the party of dignity, class, honor and as Michelle Obama said - when they go low we go high. That's what the Democratic Party is supposed to reflect. All BLM did was drag the democrat party into the gutter and proved that our progressive left can be just as disconnected and delusional as the far right.

If you watched Bill Maher on Nov 6th you saw a man named Tristin Harris try to articulate what is happening on the internet with ""information bubbles"", then in the very next segment you saw Malcolm Nance verbally throw-up the MSNBC bubble in real-time (no pun intended). He went on to say how scared he was of the Trump caravans arming themselves and likened them to the Taliban.

So delusional on so many levels, 

1. these caravans are filled with soccer moms and dentists 

2. The entire US is covered in plywood in anticipation of unrest.. But the fear wasn't that Trump would lose, they boarded-up b/c they were afraid that Trump might win!!!

Go ahead and down vote this post, and I don't expect an intelligent comment b/c I (and the world) have witnessed how easily the progressives gets triggered and that they collectively have very low emotional quotient.

That's real reality, not the shadow reality that the poisonous cable news agencies and gaslighting social media campaigns are feeding you sub conscious. I'm just afraid that our country will not be able to deprogram ourselves.. Sad.

If you like a unit- then put me down as the referring party when you submit an application. I‚Äôll come down to say hi if I‚Äôm home or we can grab a coffee!

After incentives (2-3 free months) - you can find a studio for well under $2k, or a big 1 bedroom for ~$2300 a month!! Or a 2 bedroom for under ~$3500 a month.

"This might come off as corona Cuomo vibes, but what I‚Äôm seeing in the past few weeks is not very reassuring for our future.

Halloween was pretty tame on the streets and appeared fine, but walking back from a dinner in the east village put the reality on full display.   Parties were happening across the city within apartments, some with gatherings not seen since pre covid times.   I myself was invited to several through Facebook and group chats with the invite list nearing 40 people for a tiny New York apartment for the first and 20 people for the other. 

That may seem fine for some, but when you consider the positive rate is hovering near 2%, within a group of 100 you can statistically assume that 2 people would have coronavirus.    Couple that with a mask less environment in a tiny space such as those parties and you‚Äôre setting the stage for a super spreading event.   Both parties would of had a near 50/50 chance of someone having the virus.

A similar world appeared celebrating the win of Biden.  During the day it was dancing with masks on in the streets, by nightfall dozens of indoor parties were cropping up around the city.  In East Village I walked by several large indoor parties taking place, clearly seeing packed apartments and a lack of concern.

People are losing context, being told how great New York is handling the virus and that we‚Äôre the best in the country, a country where the bar has been set incredibly low for any sort of response.   Placed into the context of parties, we‚Äôre not at a point where we can be hosting these events and expect everything to be okay.  Now is not the time to let our defenses when we see rising daily cases and the rest of the world suffering a second wave more severe than the first.  That‚Äôs how the second wave started in all of these other countries - first it was a slight increase, followed with higher case counts, and eventually things spiraled out of control and they had to lock down again.

We can work together to avoid a second lockdown and mounting deaths - just use common sense, follow health protocols like wearing a mask, and social distancing where possible.

All things said I don‚Äôt mean to set a negative tone, but I worry for our city if we don‚Äôt take more precautions.",0

"Having been born and raised in this city I have a strong preference for ""mixed minority"" neighborhoods. They are where I feel most comfortable as an Asian guy who has been labeled as deracinated and who converged to typical NYC norms growing up such as Rap music listening. 

Sociologically, mixed minority enclaves are less than 20% white and less than 50% of any other race. For example a typical mixed minority area would be the West Bronx, which is maybe 45% Black, 15% Asian, and 25% Latino, and 5% White, or many areas of Queens that are 50/50 Latino and Asian. 

According to the [Furman Center](https://furmancenter.org/research/publication/the-changing-racial-and-ethnic-makeup-of-nyc-neighborhoods), mixed minority enclaves have a lower average income, college attainment, and other metrics than single minority enclaves. For example a mixed minority area typically has a lower income than Chinatown at East Broadway, Wakefield (a West Indian area) or many predominantly Latino enclaves. 

Compared to Black majority neighborhoods which have a 17% poverty rate, mixed minority neighborhoods have a 28.8% poverty rate. This doesn't relate to one's immigration status either. 66% of people in Asian majority neighborhoods are foreign born but the college achievement level there is around twice that of a mixed minority neighborhood. 

Black majority neighborhoods have an average income of 57,847, but mixed minority neighborhoods have an average income of 44,221. That's less than even I make. 

Does anyone else here, such as mixed race folk, have a preference for mixed minority enclaves? Why are they considered less equal than monoracial minority neighborhoods?",0

"I hate to be writing about this now because I know it's a wonderful, festive time in NYC and I have been very much a part of that. But this has been ongoing, so please keep that in mind.

I bought a co-op apartment in Prospect Heights in February 2020. I am a 4th-generation Brooklynite and have happily lived in this area for 8 years. I never thought I would be able to buy, but my mom died unexpectedly in 2015, which left me with enough money for a down payment for a one bedroom. I was finally making enough of a salary to be able to afford a mortgage, and it just made sense to try to invest in something for once.  


I chose a street-facing apartment because I love being able to hear the sounds of the city from my home. All of my windows face the street. Ever since the weather got nice in April, a small group of men (anywhere from 1-5) park their car directly in front of my apartment and blast music for hours on end. Right now for instance it has been eight hours. I wish it was a party due to election results, but this is a regular thing. I never know when it will start or end, or when it will happen. I never know when I will be able to watch a movie, nap, just listen to my own music, or my apartment will just be filled with their musical choices.  


I have turned to my co-op board, who wants nothing to do with it. A couple neighbors in my building have mentioned it bothers them, but it stops there. Most of the units in my building face the back of the building (including the apartment of one of the offenders. How convenient for him!).  


I posted on a neighborhood message board, but half of the response was that I should move to the suburbs and that I am ruining the neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want to change the neighborhood, there was just no way for me to know that this portion of the block is used as a street nightclub. Had I known, I would have gladly passed up this apartment and moved on with my life. They can have it! I don't want to ruin anyone's fun. But I am stuck living here. I literally cannot afford to sell this apartment ‚Äî I would lose everything (it would cost me $50-70k, I spent $12k on closing costs, and have done $5k in repairs), which just enough for a down payment for this one-bedroom apartment. I don‚Äôt have any other home, my family is mostly dead. This is my one and only home, and it‚Äôs a nightmare due to just 2-3 people.   


I have a painful health condition that I‚Äôm awaiting surgery for. I get migraines often and sometimes just need a bit of peace, to be sick, lie down, and try to relax a bit and make the pain go away. Normal city sounds are fine and help me feel more apart of this city I love so much, but this is like sitting in a concert hall. Their concert. A friend came over today and said ‚ÄúWow, I know you‚Äôve mentioned this problem and assumed you were just sensitive to noise but this is absolutely horrible, what a shame. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great place to live.‚Äù  


I have never dealt with this before here. It‚Äôs not normal city noise. All I want is to be able to have some semblance of control of the sound waves in my apartment.   


I just feel trapped. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that just a couple men could be the reason I lose all the money I ever had ‚Äî money I only got because I lost the only family and home I had ‚Äî ¬†just to get out. But I‚Äôm verging on throwing it all away just to save my sanity and not hate my life. I am 32 and on the brink of big life choices, and this could be a determining factor on whether I will have children or not. I'm stuck here financially. I would never choose to have a baby with this going on. I may eventually need brain surgery for the thing my mom died of, and I already have anxiety about how I could possibly recover and rest here after that. It‚Äôs like a party all the time. Not a place to find comfort and recover.  


Anyway, I don't know what to do. Ideas or options? I am just not a wet blanket type of person. I was out all day yelling and partying after the election results rolled in. I just need a break from the party when I'm at home.",0

"As the title states, we got our security deposit back with a $200 charge for not allowing access to our realtor. The instances in which they‚Äôre referring to were a time when I was at work, my roommate was in the shower, and someone started knocking at the door to look at the apartment. At no time were we contacted about this, they just showed up and asked to be let in. Then the broker got mad at us for just not letting her in and ‚Äúwasting his and their time‚Äù when my roommate was not even clothed or forewarned. It turned into a whole argument, when I felt it was just insane how little respect they had for us and our time. 

The other instance was when, again, I was not at the apartment and my roommate was asleep and the broker called saying he‚Äôll be there in 15 minutes. When my roommate said no one would be available until later, it became a whole issue again, then we never heard about it until we got the charge.

Now mind you, we would have loved to let anyone in to see our apartment had it actually be coordinated properly with our schedules. But both times were sprung on us out of nowhere and we just weren‚Äôt available at the time. Is this valid, are we in the wrong, or do they have validity in charging us? Is there anything we can do to fight this, because it‚Äôs just completely absurd and we were appalled to see the charges when we were such great tenants the years that we lived there.

Hello! I wanted to see how people are doing with rent negotiation. I love in a part of south Williamsburg where I‚Äôm about a 10+ min walk to anything ‚Äúgood‚Äù in bushwick/east Williamsburg or Williamsburg, though very well connected by subways (jmz+G right there, L not too far.)

I know that 2020 has been really tough on New York and a lot of other places, so I came up with an idea that encourages people to support their own city by letting you track how much you‚Äôve helped out. I made it into a major feature called Hometowns and added it to our Zonder exploration game.

You can choose a city to earn points for as you visit local attractions or businesses in the area. To add a little competitive spirit, there‚Äôs a leaderboard that shows how much support your city has gotten compared to others around the world. I'd like to challenge NYC residents to show the world how supportive you are of your city.

Just a reminder: The local economy does need our help right now, but it‚Äôs important to stay safe first. We absolutely don‚Äôt encourage risky behavior for any amount of digital points. You can earn points for going to many outdoor venues like parks and lakes, and make sure to follow all the recommended safety guidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

because we've seen a rat - but can't believe it was a rat - maybe a something else ...

&amp;#x200B;

in details?

On Saturday night \~4am we were at Park Slope, Brooklyn at 7th ave and Union St (right near - Bank of America, 92 7th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217 [https://goo.gl/maps/YaefMnxGT3C4nxBi6](https://goo.gl/maps/YaefMnxGT3C4nxBi6) )

&amp;#x200B;

an intersection we will never forget ...

and I couldn't believe my eyes ..

&amp;#x200B;

this giant - size - a bit bigger than a well grown cat 

what seemed to be like a pet pig - because it was albino/beige in color with spots 

limited white fur ...

tail was short ...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to think that it was a pig - but the way it looked, moved, like a rat ...

it went to the sewer across the street and went on further down the street ...

&amp;#x200B;

again at first - I thought it was a pet pig that ran away ... but I was shocked and petrified ...

and didn't want to provoke it ... but my girlfriend - went a bit closer to take a look ... 

&amp;#x200B;

I really regret not trying to try to take any picture of it ...

&amp;#x200B;

since I've tried to find any info on this ... but to limited extent ... thus am posting here ...

  
but we are still not sure what kind of a creature it was - but are concluding that some sort of a giant rat

&amp;#x200B;

some info that came close

"The last time I was in Manhattan was March 13. Coronavirus was at its worst. The trains were unsafe. And my job sent employees home.

All my New York friends, disappeared. Those I thought who lived in NYC, and we're wealthy based on how they live their lifestyles, silently departed New York City because they were unable to pay rent and maintain survival in the big city.

I live in Queens. But, most of my daily life is spent on Long Island. From Rockville Centre, Hewlett Harbor, Hewlett, Elmont, Woodmere, Franklin's Square, to Baldwin and Hempstead.

This was my Manhattan.

Yesterday, I grabbed my camera and went into Manhattan to capture photography of this historic time period ---- buildings boarding up on Election Day. I'm 27, I've never seen this in my time period.

To be straightforward here: This is really the most beautiful time in Manhattan. It's not too crowded and it's not too empty. Rockefeller Center is beautiful. I've never been able to capture Rockefeller Center without my photos being photo-bombed. Furthermore, as the general New Yorker when trains were red and phone boxes were a thing in NY, anytime I was in Manhattan, I did what I had to do and got out.

Now, yesterday, I was able to explore Manhattan and take in its true beauty.

For once, I was able to negotiate a hotdog for $1.50. You would never be able to do this! The guy was nice. We talked it up for about 5-minutes. He was telling me about how bad business has been lately. Then, I joked about hotdogs being $1.00.

I was able to walk in the middle of 5th avenue without fear of being hit by a vehicle. It's rare to do this in New York City! 

Oh, and the trains. Let me tell you, I've never seen subways so clean ever! It use to be a load of shit everywhere. Now, it's a masterpiece of clean beauty.

Lastly, the big red steps. I avoided the tourism hangout spot because of the crowds. But, going to the top level, New York is beautiful from a far. 

I want NYC to stay like this for a little while. I'm sure to re-visit Manhattan again before a vaccine is released. What sucked, there were no place to hangout inside. 

Deadass, I love my city. I don't plan to move from NY any time soon. Been through thick and thin. I'm sure to keep pushing through with my family by my side. All those who left NY, you're missing it's true beauty right now.",0

"Alway confirm if the price listed is ‚Äògross rent‚Äô (the actual amount you will pay every month), or if it is net effective, an average of your monthly rent FOR THE FIRST YEAR ONLY. (ex. If the LL is offering 1 month free rent on a 12 month lease of a $2000 unit, then the free month is deducted from the yearly rent, and divided by the 12 mo., giving you the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô monthly rent after savings.  

Ex. $2000 apartment with 1 mo. free on 12 mo. lease: $2000 x 11 = $22,000 / 12 = $1,833.33  This is why you‚Äôll see lots of ‚Äòbargains‚Äô in your searches.

"Summarizing their words to use for *your* convenience! I used to do this on the daily COVID-19 thread for quite a while (a few months), but I‚Äôll still do this as necessary until I don‚Äôt have any spare time, or work / other things take precedence, or the pandemic is finally gone. Hope you enjoy!  

Try to keep the conversations *only* about what Bill de Blasio and/or Andrew Cuomo said during these press conference(s). I‚Äôll keep tweaking this as we go along in the coming days, if need be.

You can find Mayor de Blasio‚Äôs press conference stream at the [NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office](https://www.youtube.com/user/NYCMayorsOffice) YouTube channel, and later on, his transcripts can be found online at the [NYC Mayor‚Äôs Office](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news.page) website.

For Andrew Cuomo, it‚Äôs a mix sometimes where his press conferences can be found, sometimes [online](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news) on the NY Governor‚Äôs website, other times if it‚Äôs solely done by phone, some news outlets stream that too. But when it‚Äôs finished, there‚Äôs usually a [SoundCloud](https://m.soundcloud.com/nygovcuomo) upload for that too.",0
"So apparently ConEd has been unable to read my building meter for 13 months, and then back billed me for over 1K. ConEd is saying that they are installing smart meters in a week or so which may or may not change the total (could be higher or lower) and have advised me to not pay the bill until this smart meter reading comes though. 

When I said I thought it was a bit nuts that someone hadn't been able to read the meter for 13 months and I wasn't notified, they said that it was written on our bill that it was an estimate and that they needed access to the meter (in small print, last page of paper bill. I also pay online and it's not noted on the payment screen). They said they notified my landlord somehow, but admitted they didn't call him. Not sure how they apparently notified him? When I contacted my landlord, he said he had not been notified and advised me to go through the NY State Dep. of Public Service to file a claim, but that could take 2 weeks and once the bill is adjusted from the smart meter I will only have 5 days to pay. 

Just curious if anyone has had this happen to them and if there was any advice about how to handle?",0
"I‚Äôve been collecting restaurant recommendations for the past 3 months.

I have over 1000 now. Most I would‚Äôve never come across on review sites or delivery apps.

Most that would never fit the ‚Äútop 10 restaurant‚Äù criteria set by the typical review site, whatever that means.

I‚Äôve so far been sharing them on [r/nyctakeout](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyctakeout/) and [r/FoodNYC](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/).

And now I and two friends have created an [app that shows you each and every one of those recommendations](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/piky/id1534822032) (well, 500 or so of them, still adding them to the app).

You‚Äôll see great spots like Up Thai, Raku, Ho Foods, and Wah Fung No. 1 Fast Food.

I know those places, you might think. Nothing new‚Ä¶

But then there are others that you may not know about. Places like Karczma, Taiwan Pork Chop House, and Claudette (ok maybe you do know about these places - great, tell us some places that you think only you know about that we should know about!).

Point is, we all know great restaurants and think because they‚Äôre good, they must be known by others as well, right? Well, not exactly. Before this, I had no idea Little Alley sold awesome frozen dumplings. Or that you can get great fried chicken at Pelicana and BBQ Olive Chicken. Or that there's an underground restaurant called Streecha in the East Village.

tl;dr

We all know great restaurants so why not crowdsource all our recommendations onto one app?",0

"Every time we finish these god damn big 4 holidays...

Halloween
Thanksgiving
Christmas
New Years

We are super lonely throughout and after. Thus we feel like we need to invest more into relationships and family to make the lonely weather more tolerable. Then we solidify those commitments with New Years resolutions. 

Then the big emotional ass rape comes with..

Valentines Day- (Dont even get me started on the desperation and manipulation from all the interrelated parties leading up to that day.) 

Then we feel basically dead inside that whole day or usually let down by; someone else's efforts or lack thereof, their response to our efforts, or not having anyone to give or receive efforts from. After the recovery from the seasonal loneliness pain, we yet again reaffirm our commitments to this being ""my year"" even if we do so unconsciously. 


Then boom the spring blitz comes. One or two my ex loves once implied if not directly said; you can always tell the loosey gooseys by how they are always the first ones out with the super short dresses even when the weather barely, if not at all, calls for that type of attire. I disagree. I respect a woman's right to hunt. And as Dominic Toretto once said.. WINNING IS WINNING. 

Hating manipulative wifeys logic aside, we are all sprinting to get in that ""New relationship"" (even if its not the right fit) come spring. And as soon as we have something remotely intriguing we self sabotage because, and its a hard selfish fact to admit, but given the fitness and financial ambitious trends.. ever en vogue in our tri-state lives, we always gamble and risk everything we worked so hard to get, just for an inch or two of someone or something better. I sadly also fall victim to this sick cycle of chasing the highs of potential risks vs dream realities.

Then the ""New"" disappoints with more ^old bullshit and we are desperate again with summer hunting season over to grab whatever is left on the shelves, right around august and september, just to avoid those same damn lonely up coming holidays. Even though we know we are gonna be arguing throughout with our risky short term investments, especially when we see it coming, because even if the people we have, are who think we want, we dont actually want them. We hate who we have to be to sustain them. And I am sure they hate the fake faces they wear as well to sustain us. Relationships turn into jobs, and I am sure we are good at our careers. But a lot of us cant keep a decent job past 2 yrs, 6 months, and some times after that 2 week cash in. Lol. Like staying too long just for the ""benefits"" aint worth it. 

I had a good and rough 2018

2019 was bullshit

Oddly 2020 is a wild card. 

But 2021 feels like the same damn pattern creeping up on me and happening again. 

I have learned that yes, you have to be confortable alone, which I am. But damn nigga I like pussy and I aint got one being alone. And professional sex workers are solid. But ""oh baby, I like raw"". 

Porn keeps the shitbag side of myself at bay but only for so long. And its like penny wise but dollar foolish with regards to actual life experiences against viewing porn, cause when that shit balances out later it costs you more in life. You're older doin crazy things that you shouldve done when you were Young but you kept watching porn. Now either she doesnt live up to your expectations or your mad at your self because you think you arent living up to hers expectations and oddly blame her. Porn logic is very often flawed. With each new vag u get it slips right through your fingers no matter how much trump.. grab em by it macheezmo you put forth.

For me: 

Sure a lot of them want to stick around but after a while I dont like who they are and more importantly I dont like who I am with them. So yet again as I change, I reach for another platea, all while chasing the ever elusive stability and permanence of someone growing with me in the same direction without her always having to be New~ 
~Ideally she ""Just Is"" and thats more than enough. 

Now Im in my mid 30s. Two women of my children, both successful in their own right. But both are nonoptions for various reasons. To the point that I have to make myself a nonoption to them. As such I consciously try not to focus on being overly successful to avoid relationships with them and others because some chicks are like vipers when they see the coins. Its like they can smell it on you even if you try to hide it or atleast dont boast. Simult√°neamente its hell of a thing to ask a mind to comprehend that if she makes way way more than you, and if you definitively paid for her to have that position, that you still gotta make punishment payments cause she cant stand to see you happy.. even if you alone nigga, she still wanna see you suffer. I mean dont even get me started on the seconds one. I mean why I gotta pay the home rent, office rent, and buy Christmas toys in october... But im not allowed to talk about money because im throwing it in her face. Nigga look at my fuckin Bank accounts. Bruised as fuck aint the words. My accounts got gangbanged and for some reason it doesnt feel consentual.

"When cold weather comes, quality goes down, especially for fruit, but vegs too. I live on the UWS, and can't afford to pay ripoff prices or throw inedible stuff away. Any suggestion of places that have good produce during the winter?

Vegs is easier but still - I got a cabbage to make autumn cole-slaw from my local market and it was bitter. A waste. 

I don't want to overpay, but there must be somewhere around these parts where they make an effort to get stuff (esp fruit, which is harder during the winter) that is good and doesn't wind up getting thrown away b/c it's inedible.

"Thinking about starting up a business, wanted some feedback. I'm based in New York and work in the apparel industry. I want to create a website that allows users to:
1. Get basic tshirts hoodies sweatshirt blanks with the option to get custom labels and prints of their own and package it for them. (Basically kickstart a brand and give products ready for them to ship to their customers). 
2. Allow bigger brands to outsource their production by placing larger orders overseas.
3. A marketplace where people can post their designs and we will print them when ordered and split ƒ∫
profits with the designer. 

Would love some honest feedback!!!

"**What to do at home**

Step 1: [Find your polling location](https://findmypollsite.vote.nyc/). You must vote at the correct polling location. At the site I linked, the location will be in red. (The blue one is the early voting location)

Step 2: Bring your Fast Pass if you have one. They are plastic cards with barcodes on them that many people got in the mail. They also contain your ED/AD number. If you don't have one, just write down your ED/AD number from the above site. It's on the line ""Election/Assembly District"".

Step 3: Bring your ID. But do not hand it to a poll worker unless asked.

Step 4: Do not wear any political attire, such as shirts or hats that have a candidate's name on them. You may get turned away if you wear something like that.

**What to do when you get there**

SKIP THE INFORMATION TABLE LINE. The information table only looks up your ED/AD number, which you already have from the steps above. The check-in tables will be labelled with an ED/AD number and will have their own lines. Jump right on!

Once you are inside, have your fast pass ready if you have one. If not, they will just need your name and address. Do not hand over your ID unless they ask!

**More pro tips**

Do not take pictures inside! It's against the law to take a picture inside a polling location.

If you are on the end of the line when polls close, you will vote. Even if you're not in the building yet. They process the entire line. They just won't let *more* people onto the end of the line once polls close.

If you have a disability (like if you rely on a cane or wheelchair) you can skip all the lines. Just go right on in. Same applies if you have an injury, like if your foot is in a boot.

If you have an absentee ballot, skip all the lines. There should be a box right inside and you can just drop it off. Make sure it's sealed and signed (just follow all the instructions carefully). It does not need postage if you're dropping it at a poll site.

**Questions?**

Hope these are helpful, and see you at the polls! I'll be here tonight and tomorrow to answer as many questions as I can. A few questions came up in my [early voting thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jhjpnn/i_am_an_nyc_poll_worker_here_are_the_top_things_i/) so you could also check that out.",0
"Has anyone noticed an increase in people on the subway who just outright refuse to wear a mask? I feel like in the last month or so it has gotten much worse.

I‚Äôm not talking about people wearing it as a chin strap or wearing it below the nose. I‚Äôm talking about people with no mask to be seen. I‚Äôm also not talking about people who do not wear it on the platform, I‚Äôm talking about on the actual subway car. Whether you think masks work or not, it just feels like the right thing to do when we‚Äôre all jammed together in a subway car.

I‚Äôve even seen people who wear their mask on the platform and then TAKE IT OFF once they get on the subway. It drives me nuts.

"So my landlord sucks (what else is new in NYC), and I realized the first winter in my new apartment that the windows are basically useless in terms of preventing heat loss.  The condensation on the inside of the window creates so much water that it pools on the sheetrock windowsill

Ultimately, the windows should be replaced and the exterior wall reinsulated (it's definitely not insulated)

"today i was at the farmers market, trailing ish behind an older lady with a very sweet dog. i had seen her at the start of the market saying ""happy halloween you WITCH"" it what seemed like an unpleasant tone. i finally caught up with her mid-market, and saw her turn around and yell ""piss on you"" - i was thinking she was kind of crazy, but, since I work at the market was curious as to what happened.

we finally were on line at the same stand, and her dog jumped on me. i said how sweet the pup was, and the woman nearly broke down. her dog let a little pee out near both stands, and the owners became very upset. i understand both sides, but it's an outdoor market where dogs are allowed.

she told me it had been her first time out in four months off her street, and she felt that every scolding had been a personal attack. that she would have gone home and felt badly and ashamed for hours. 

the truth is, the guy who yelled at her is known to be a mega asshole, and he just decided to pick on her that day- she would have never known that, and he would have never known her anxiety in being outside as a 70 year old single woman. 

it just reminded me to be more patient and remember that even in frustrating moments, just take one step back and try to understand where a person is coming from.

Hi r/NYC,

I made it back to the city for the first time since last year.  I had a very nice visit, not as intense as last year but still very immersive. 

Pictures: [https://www.flickr.com/gp/158149703@N04/0032XG](https://www.flickr.com/gp/158149703@N04/0032XG) 

Stepping out of Port Authority certainly felt different. Compared to the last time I set foot in the city it was desolate  especially for Friday night. There should have been flocks of people heading to shows, bars and getting ready to take on the night. Times Square while still not completely empty had a notably dark and gritty feel, something I have not in my lifetime experienced. Looking out of the New Yorker Hotel onto the skyline I pondered, was it too early to come back? 

My trip turned out amazing. I went to the furthest northern reaches of Manhattan for the first time and then all the way down to the beaches by Coney Island. I made my initial exploration of the vast and varied corridors of the Met. I went down to the brand new Pier 26 and took in the stunning views along the Brooklyn Height Promenade. I went out at night to the Upper East Side and down in Greenwich Village. 

New York City even in a pandemic surpasses any other city  in normal times. It is amazing just how many people are out in the streets going about their day. The city attracts people from all around the world, each and everyone so much focused on a purpose and mission. There is nothing so satisfying as to go for a walk and take in the vibrant streets and interesting points of view.

I absolutely love getting a feel for a city and what local life is all about. The NYC I experienced was for the most part a local experience, no dazed tourists or photo obsessed influencers to break the immersion. It was sad to see Broadway shuttered and no live performances to see. However the dancing nature of the city is still kept alive by the street performers and outdoor patio players. I even listened to a cellist playing in a cozy corner in Central Park. 

I‚Äôm glad I made it out to the city and will definitely return soon. I can‚Äôt wait to explore more neighborhoods, see more museums and continue to get a better feeling of each borough.  ‚ÄúAs for New York City, it is a place apart. There is not its match in any other country in the world.‚Äù - Pearl S. Buck

"I‚Äôve been trying to get any response about this from the BOE for days, and since I‚Äôm genuinely absentee (as in not living at the address where I‚Äôm registered at the moment) I thought I‚Äôd try here before trekking back to Queens to vote Tuesday. 

According to the tracker, my ballot was received on 10/20, and the status at the top of the page reads Ballot Received. However I‚Äôve seen pictures of other people‚Äôs tracking where the top of the page reads Ballot Received Valid. Now, Ballot Received Valid does appear in my Tracking History, but it‚Äôs earlier than the current ballot status of Ballot Received. 

Does this mean some issue was found with my ballot and it‚Äôs now in dispute? Obviously I‚Äôm worried that it was marked valid and then validity was rescinded. Could also just be a weird glitch and nothing to worry about! It would be nice if the BOE could return an email or if their phone system wasn‚Äôt a useless automated series of circular menus, but here we are. Fortunately I‚Äôm just in a different borough, so I won‚Äôt be disenfranchised by quarantine restrictions if I need to make an 11th hour return to vote. But still, the ease with which this confusion could be avoided (any kind of reply from the BOE, a FAQ detailing the various ballot statuses) is mind boggling. 

Thanks for any insight, Reddit!",0
"Hi there,
Hope you all are well and safe.

I was living in the city before lockdown, but then decided to stay with few hours away in a different state which is unfortunately on the travel advisory list. I am going to come back soon because I have an exam scheduled and will also be looking to move out of my place around the same time. I was considering quarantining for 14 days but saw Cuomo recently changed the rules to testing before and after travel. 

I was wondering if anybody who recently traveled can advise what is the better option, both in terms of safety and precautions. 

- How easy is it to get a covid test in NYC? Is there any risk in terms of being exposed when surrounded by people coming to get a test? And if I come to NYC on a Saturday and need to go somewhere on the following Saturday but take the Covid test on a Wednesday or Thursday of the week, will that be enough time to get the results? 

- Anybody do the 14 day quarantine? Any tips for adequately preparing to stay indoors most of the time? I guess I‚Äôll be stocking up on food and hand wash clothes for now since we don‚Äôt have indoor laundry unit lol. 

- How is everything in terms of safely traveling, public transportation wise and all. It seems quite safe as far as I see, but I have hardly left to go anywhere in these past few months and want to make sure I take all the precautions possible

Thanks!!",0

"After living in an apartment for a year, we left and my landlord refuses to give us back the deposit. His argument is ""there are new cracks on the wall tiles and floor"". We did not cause this, this was based on wear and tear. The apt had no heat the first 2 months and was caused by thermal expansion. He refuses to believe this and thinks we purposely cracked the floors and walls. 

I put in a case on Turbo Court so I can take the landlord to small claims court. After 2 weeks, I still have not received any updates. I called the small claims court and they said it is closed until next year. This is very frustrating as we could really use the $1,700 our landlord is holding from us. 

Is there any word on a possible reopening date for small claims court?",0

"A week ago I was the happiest guy alive...today, I'm at one of the deepest lows of my life. I met someone on Craigslist who was renting a 3br apartment. According to the guy (lets call him the Craigslist contact), he is the leaseholder who lived there for years but decided to move out, and sublet the rooms.    After checking out the apartment and meeting the current tenants (not the guy I've been talking to), I paid  1mo rent + 1mo security (via Zelle) for November to the craiglist contact.   I moved in a few days ago, and it has been a nightmare since.   

The day after I moved in, the two other roommates told me they decided to move and would be out within a few days.  To make things worse, a day later, the power goes out.    According to the guy on the lease, he's been paying utilities. According to the building's super, ""everything looks ok in the basement."" Supposedly an electrician was sent to fix the issue, but the power is still out three days later. 

To top it all off, I just got a call from the building's owner/landlord, and found out that my craigslist contact hasn't paid rent for 14 months, and is currently getting sued for it.  He was surprised to hear the apartment had a new tenant but was pretty clear that he's been getting screwed and that I got myself into a big mess.    He suggested that I move out ASAP and try to get my money back,, but I have a feeling that will be difficult/impossible.   The landlord said that he expects the City Marshalls to come anytime and bolt up the apartment.  I know there is a hold on evictions right now, but I'm not sure if this situation qualifies for protection, considering how long this situation has been going on. I really also cant live at this place anymore without power.  

Does anyone have advice on how I should go about getting my money back? Today is the 1st, so I must contact the craiglist connect today to make things clear that I intend to leave ASAP.   I figure that I may need to pursue a civil suit, but I am generally less than optimistic with the legal system. I am currently looking at new places to move, but I'm just frustrated that I may have lost a lot of money.. Any advice or encouragement would be super welcome. Thanks :)",0

The gist: 

* For travelers who were in another state for¬†more than 24 hours:
   * Travelers must obtain a test within three days of departure from that state.
   * The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.
   * On day 4 of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain seek another COVID test. If both tests come back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.

Can someone shed some light on this matter? I'm supposed to travel roundtrip from NYC to Los Angeles this weekend. I will leave on Friday evening and return on Sunday morning (total trip is about 36 hours). I won't have time on Saturday to get tested in LA. If I get tested on Thursday or Friday in NYC, will that be okay to let me back into NYC on Sunday? Like, as far as the ""you need to test negative before arriving in NYC"" part of this goes - who is enforcing this? Will it be the airline before I board my flight that confirms I was tested? Or is it enforced once I arrive in NYC? 

i want to make it clear I am absolutely down to get a test before I fly back into NYC i just hope they will accept one that was done in NYC prior to traveling to another state

"Posting to receive some different perspectives. Please hold of on all comments that contain hyperbolic doomsday news such as ‚ÄúReal estate will crash in 2021 or 45% of New Yorkers are moving out to Florida‚Äù
I‚Äôve already read all those headlines.

Background, I‚Äôve lived in New York for almost 10 years and for 8 of those years, have always been looking at real estate. At some point, I considered even getting a license to do it part-time, as it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm passionate about. So for what it‚Äôs worth, I do believe I have a good pulse on prices.

My savings didn‚Äôt really grow exponentially until joining Google, for obvious reasons. I‚Äôm talking about networth from $100k to $800k in four years (including retirement). Most of it is with stock appreciation and also single picks that played out well in the past few years. I can write a post on this if people are interested.

I‚Äôve always mentally had a down payment number of when I‚Äôd feel ready to buy a home, however kept waiting and waiting as my stock portfolio grew, and didn‚Äôt make sense to purchase $1M+ 1beds next to the google office.

Given where we are today, prices have cooled and I finally feel ready to buy, as I have more than enough in assets for a 15-20% down.

Recently I have put an offer in for an almost new 2bd/2ba in the heart of Brooklyn for around $1.2M, low monthlies around $550 taxes and HOA. 13 yr tax abatement left. Mortage lending for 10/1 arm is around 2.5% @15% down or 2.375@ 20% down. 30 year fixed is 2.75% as this is jumbo loan.

Here is the kicker.

I actually want to move to California in a year. Why? Better weather and outdoor space. Where? Maybe LA, but open to Bay. I mention this because, given the obvious this apartment is in New York.

My rationale of buying is two fold:

1) I always want a place in New York to call home or to visit. And this place is absolutely beautiful.

2) I want to play the appreciation game. This place has a cap rate of 4%, and even in today‚Äôs COVID market I can rent out at break even of mortage. Post COVID, there‚Äôs possibility for a $1500/mo spread. If market can appreciate to $1.5M in 5 years, given the cash flow and interest deduction, I can net about $350k given assumption of $5k rent for 2b/2ba.

That‚Äôs about 140% return on investment. 

*3) a third is diversification strategy. I‚Äôm 90% invested in the market, and find RE to be a bit more less volatile.

Another detail, today I have really cheap rent in a lottery building. Paying around $2200 for a luxury 1bd. I could rent this out or if I don‚Äôt buy - eat the cost every month I don‚Äôt live there BUT have the flexibility to move around whenever as it‚Äôs not that big of an expense.

My question to you all who have bought or in the process: what‚Äôs your experience so far with owning condos and the overhead?

Is out of state / opposite coast tenant management reasonable?

Should I keep money in the market and just buy in California?

Hedge half in ZM in case COVID never ends? ;) kidding of course.

TLDR; Want to buy property in NY. However plan to move to Cali. Have the money, but should I pull the trigger?

"Hey all, I have some general questions about the current state of nyc. I‚Äôm from Fairfield county (CT) and ended up in Charlotte, NC after college. It‚Äôs a nice enough city but I always wanted to end up back in the northeast since my family is still in CT. I never thought I could afford it comfortably, until the past couple years where I got my career figured out. 

So, people are fleeing the city because of the pandemic but it seems like a great opportunity to get established there more easily due to the rent prices coming down and my current work situation (remote).

I make about $100-110k and I want to convince my company to let me keep working remotely for now, which is highly likely since my boss is already 100% remote. Then the plan would be to move up there around spring time. I own a condo and I could sell it pretty quickly, no lease to break or anything. Here are some questions I have for you all, I know a lot is up in the air but just trying to get a sense of how New Yorkers feel. 

1. There are a bunch of 700-800 square foot apartments in neighborhoods like the upper east side for $2500 a month or less. If I sign a year lease, do you think the rent prices are going to jump right back to where they were pre-covid, or will it be more gradual? What are my rights as a renter in a market priced unit (if any)?

2. Am I being too optimistic about the future state of the city? I‚Äôm assuming restrictions will get bad again in the winter and loosen up in the spring, and that in the long term, nyc will always be nyc. 

3. Any general advice for moving during the pandemic?

4. Are there any areas of manhattan I should avoid living in? I was looking into mostly the upper east side, lower east side, or east village. 

I heard diblasio is reducing nypd funding by a significant amount so I‚Äôm curious how that‚Äôs playing out too.",0

"Long story short, moved into a building in Bushwick which wasn't ready to be lived in (no hot water for 3 weeks, no internet for a month) and the landlord became only less helpful. When covid hit I left. Come the last month of the lease I reached out about security deposits and he said within a month of the lease ending. 

.

Well....

 .  
  
A month came and went and I'll let you guess what happened. He kept it. I reached out and when I let slip I knew my tenant rights and I wasn't in NYC anymore he went silent. I called, emailed, texted, and even sent a letter of demand and it was nothing. I fill out a form for rent security complaints on the NYC Bureau of Consumer Frauds and Protections, and let him know I'll be mailing it tonight. FIVE FUCKING MINUTES LATER, he says it will be sent this week.",0

"Hey, a bit troubled here because my partner and I recently moved into a 1bdrm in June and we just got hit with a whopping 745$ bill because they are charging us all at once the 119 days since we moved in. We have paid apparently only their estimated guess to our electricity usage, since no one had come in to read the meter until last week. The first recorded number is from June 22 and it reads 42830. The next number recorded is 46241 on Oct 19. We had 2 acs, but one was off 95% of the time unless it was extremely hot and the bedroom ac was on energy saver, even if left overnight. 

My partner and I are both unemployed at the moment since our jobs are not open due to Covid, and we're running through our savings because of the lack of the extra funds from the weekly unemployment. I understand because we're home all the time that our electricity bill usage is well high, however is there anything we could say to the customer service representative to either split the bill or have it lowered? The bill was originally almost 1k but they deducated what we've already paid these past few months.",0
"I hate moving and enjoy my apartment, however, rents have fallen quite a bit and I can‚Äôt imagine renewing at my current price. Same floor plan as mine is listed $500 less across the street. My lease is up for renewal in 4 months. 

Each year here they‚Äôve always increased. Last renewal the tried to increase by $125/mo and I think we got them down to $75, which still wasn‚Äôt great but at least we set a tone of negotiating. That last renewal was in March right as Covid hit, so the timing wasn‚Äôt great for me. We‚Äôve never missed rent, always paid on time, tip the super, quiet, clean, etc. 

Any advice on timing or approach? I was thinking of contacting the broker we used a few years ago to get in here, just to see if maybe I can pay him a few hundred dollars and have him get it down. He‚Äôs tight with the owners here and they are exclusive with him.

"While exploring New York City in the 3 years I've lived here, I've found myself ordering my favorite sandwich in delis all over New York. The local deli's are pretty good, but being in Greenwich Village they're quite pricey (6 bucks)

My favorite place I've been to was in Brooklyn, On the corner of Meeker Ave and Union Ave, across the street from Mt Carmel Triangle. From the 3 times I've ordered Bacon Egg &amp; Cheeses there, they've all been fantastic. The cheese is melted to the perfect level, and the egg is actually soft and melty like the cheese itself. Portions have been more than usual, all the while being half the price of what I was use to. At the price of 3 dollars, you really can't beat that anywhere.

"It seems extremely odd that NY hasn't already legalized recreational marijuana. I understand Cuomo used to be against both medical and recreational marijuana, but he has since switched his stances on both medical and recreational. Along with the fact that many states around NY are legalizing recreational and drastically improving their medical when compared to NY's, which hasn't really improved at all since 2018. NY is already losing many people who are buying their products, both medical and recreational products, outside NY. Not to mention that NJ is bound to legalize recreationally, which is literally like a 30 min or less drive from NYC.

Cuomo says he is currently looking to legalize recreational use in 2021, however if he is true to his word (he isn't), that means at the very least it will take until 2022 until it is rolled out. Just all seems like a joke and the lawmakers, along with Cuomo, are figuring out how to make the most money from this, which is a joke considering they are losing money right now if you think about all the people buying out of state. What is stopping all the assembly men from writing legislature legalizing recreational marijuana today?

He smokes cigarettes on the fire escape and is still having people over. I'm in my mid 30s and really don't want to deal with this. I'm also not a jerk. I'm cool with people having people over. And I know it's NYC. But he's been a lot. 

I resigned my lease a month ago and he moved in a week ago. Tossing that out there.

Can anyone offer up any advice on how to deal with this situation? I love my apartment, but would leave it in a heartbeat to get out of this situation. Not sure if I can since I'm tied to my lease. I'm sure people will tell me to go speak to him. I actually have and so has the building owner (as I mentioned earlier). He's a kid who wants to party. So I think all convos have and will fall on deaf ears.

I appreciate any advice anyone can offer.",0

"I'm at a loss of words.  


After following their instructions every step of the way, I learn today that the DMV has lost my official Vehicle Title and other documents after using their ""Secure"" lockbox system.  


I purchased a vehicle with an out of state title which was signed off to me and I gathered that document along with all other DMV requests such as a notarized bill of sale and contacted the DMV for the safest way to get this processed. I was instructed to drop it off at a secure lock box of which I did and waited patiently 6 weeks.  


I have probably called in 5 times with 2 hour holds only to be told to wait for a call back which I never received. I did not receive any confirmation regarding receipt of my documents and today I had enough and went to the DMV in person.  


They are not seeing anyone without an appointment which you can only get for unrelated issues but a nice security guard did check my ID and reported back to me that they have no record of ever receiving my documents which were dropped off 6 weeks ago in addition to mentioning I am not the only who experienced this.  


There is no accountability and of course there is nothing they can do, I don't understand how they allow sensitive documents to be processed this way and they only want originals. I remember my gut feeling of uneasiness when I was dropping the docs off to their lockbox.  


What can I do in this situation? I was trying to get my vehicle registered in my name. Because the registration was not processed, the official title signed off to me was lost along with the notarized bill of sale.. What can I do now?",0

"So don't sure if this is the best place to post this but like a lot of people, me and my husband are reevaluating things because of the pandemic. Just some background on us: We're nearing our forties and childfree. We work in tech. I'm hispanic and he's from the UK. We're no strangers to big cities and like the amenities of them; diversity, good food and arts. We've lived in LA, London and now NYC. Out of all those places, LA was my favorite because the food, events, and access to mountains and beaches. London I liked the least because of the weather, hard to get things done and more soulless than the other two. 

We like NYC but as we get older, it's been harder to meet people our age. However, we've been here only three years. We want to buy a place but it's pretty much impossible here and of course, it's super expensive and right now we can't enjoy any of what we are paying for. The apartment feels smaller of course, and we feel like we're just seeing the difficulties of a big city and not the benefits. 

At the same time, we aren't sure we can live in a small town or any place that doesnt have the things a big city offers. Anyone sort of in the same boat or have any suggestions of where New Yorkers might be happy without the cost?",0

Cause their web-site still states Oct 9. Either way seems pretty shitty way of conducting business. Shouldn‚Äôt they say it‚Äôs an option if that‚Äôs an option?

" Hey guys, was just slaving away at my office job when I came up with the fantasy of running my own clothing store here in NYC and curious how viable ya'll think it is. I buy almost all of my clothes from online websites, the type that show you ads on insta or whatever, and I'm usually pretty frustrated by the fact that there's no physical stores that sell that type of avant garde/edgy/meme clothes at a decent price point in person (e.g. [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0021/5629/8301/products/fd03b530f5196e40c3fe7767e270a04c\_590x.jpg?v=1582270422](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0021/5629/8301/products/fd03b530f5196e40c3fe7767e270a04c_590x.jpg?v=1582270422) which I just bought).

So what if I struck up a deal with some of those online meme retailers from aliexpress to purchase $10,000 of merch at a decent discount, opened up a physical store, and started selling them at a decent markup? It would still be cheaper than most ""fashionable"" clothes in NYC. Rent would be painful but things are pretty cheap due to covid (sadly) pushing people out. My napkin math tells me I'd need to sell around $1500 of clothes a day to be pretty successful.

"The number of online Trump enablers who seem to relish in the suffering of metro areas perplex me. The fact that elected officials with statistics in hand echoe their nonsense is even more confusing

Do they know that [blue districts make up around two thirds of the US economy?](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/). 

Do they know that NYC itself contributes around [8% of this country's GDP?](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/11-mind-blowing-facts-about-new-yorks-economy-2019-4-1028134328#) Some people are drunk on making cities pay for the crime of dominating America's cultural sphere and presenting a conception of the country that they don't like. They are literally cheering for the demise of their own country. It's even more confusing when you get people living in these very metro areas (like my brother) cheering along with them. Like bro **you live in a fucking blue district***! What are you cheering with these people for

We already know that Senate Republicans don't want to help states [with their budget loss](https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/07/republican-coronavirus-stimulus-proposal-includes-no-new-funding-for-state-and-local-governments-democrats-sought-875-billion.html) if said states have ""spending that they view as wasteful"". Regardless of how you feel about this idea of wasteful spending (and God does the fucking MTA need to get its shit fixed), forcing states to restructure themselves in the middle of the pandemic while not providing an adequate safety net is not the way to go. If you're gonna tell states to full spending, you have to provide a viable alternative for all the people with legitimate problems who will be cut out. But let's be fucking real here, the only thing the Republican party can agree on is cutting taxes, anti-abortion laws and LGBTQ-bshing. Anything that involves coming up with something original, it fails. That's why they couldn't even agree with a replacement healthcare plan that doesn't screw over people with pre-existing conditions, Trump's ""infrastructure week"" (he's been saying that shit for 4 years now), immigration reform, a actual solution for the housing crisis and even their climate change plan was made by a small chunk of the party rather than all of them coming together to ash it out. The GOP can only say no. 

I don't care if Trump or even Biden wins at this point. While we were all locked down,  seeing trailers filled with dead bodies, watching doctors and nurses plead for more equipment, hearing from friends or family members that they'd lost someone, I saw another side of the country cheer and jeer, politicians play favorites with essential supplies. This shit ain't going with Trump. If we are going to be seen as undeserving citizens of a crime-riden anarchist shithole, then let's not taint our moral superiors with our dirty money and keep it to ourselves.

"I have been looking at condos online for a while now, I kind of enjoy it!  I've viewed a few in the past, but never got a realtor as we were a bit indecisive.

I had a realtor to buy a house 10 years ago (not in NY) and used the same one to sell same house 2 years ago.  It worked fine, but that was a $200k house and I was living in NYC, so I didn't mind paying the commissions.   Now I'm looking to spend $700k-1M and the 3% commission on both sides that the seller pays seems crazy when it could be $50k.

"President Trump‚Äôs  allies have promoted claims of corruption aimed at the former vice  president‚Äôs son in an effort to damage the Biden campaign.

President  Trump‚Äôs allies have long promoted claims of corruption about Joseph R.  Biden Jr.‚Äôs son Hunter in a bid to damage Mr. Biden‚Äôs presidential  campaign. The accusations intensified in recent days when some of Mr.  Trump‚Äôs associates, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani,  provided material for a New York Post article  detailing some of the allegations. The Post reported that the F.B.I.  had seized a computer that purportedly belonged to Hunter Biden.

The  Biden campaign has rejected the accusations. Many questions remain  about the origins of the allegations themselves, the laptop and what, if  anything, agents are investigating.

## What are the allegations Mr. Trump and his allies are making?

The  Post article relied on documents purportedly taken from the computer to  try to buttress an unsubstantiated argument peddled by Mr. Giuliani and  other Trump supporters: that as vice president, Mr. Biden had shaped  American foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit his son. The events are  the latest chapter in a more than two-year effort by the president and  his allies to uncover damning information about the Bidens, a pursuit  that also helped prompt Mr. Trump‚Äôs impeachment.

Mr.  Biden has long said he knew nothing about his son‚Äôs business activities  in Ukraine. But the article suggested that the former vice president  met with an adviser to a Ukrainian energy company whose board Hunter  Biden sat on, Burisma Holdings. The article referred to an email that  the adviser, Vadym Pozharskyi, sent to Hunter Biden thanking him for  ‚Äúgiving an opportunity to meet your father‚Äù and to spend ‚Äúsome time  together.‚Äù [UFC 254 Live Stream](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFC254tvs/)

 A Biden campaign spokesman said Mr. Biden‚Äôs official schedules did not  show a meeting between the two men. A lawyer for Hunter Biden, George  Mesires, told The Washington Post that ‚Äúthis purported meeting never happened.‚Äù",0

"I worked Early Voting today.  


At my site, we were told to show up 2 hours before hand to make sure EVERYTHING was set up correctly.  On a normal election day, showing up an hour is enough time to prep and get ready.  


At my site, the line wrapped around the block 1 1/2 times.  For most part it was orderly, and the longest wait it took was 2 hours.   The smart ones brought their own folding or lawn chairs.  Some were already in line when I got to the site at 8 AM.  


If you're dropping off absentee ballots, you can bring them to the Information Desk and drop them off.  You don't have to wait in line.  If you want to vote in person, you have to wait on the line.  Depending on your site, priority is given to handicap and elderly.  You have to let the poll worker at the door know.

  
Some tips for voting.  
If you have a chair, I would bring a chair.   
On your ballot, only fill in one oval per line.  If you fill in too many oval, say every time you see your candidate's name, the scanner will flag it.  You then have a choice of returning the ballot, or continuing to cast it.  If you cast it, I was told the outcome will be a 'null' ballot.

You can take your ballot back, and ask to receive new one.  Please do not throw away your ballot.  As poll workers, EVERY ballot has to be accounted for.  The numbers reported from the Scanners, affidavits and ballots given out have to match up.  We can not leave until this is reconciled.  


Please don't walk away until you get confirmation from the scanner that your vote is cast.   
Some of think there is active voter suppression.  I do know NYC Board of Elections increased the number of Early Voting sites from 60 for the June Primary to almost 90 for this election cycle.  As a poll worker, I did not see any active attempt at voter suppression.  You may have a poll worker who gave out incorrect information, that's likely due to poor training.  Everything we do is done in a bi-partisan team of two, and sometimes with a police officer.  Especially if it involves unjamming a scanner, or opening it.  
Taking photos inside the poll site.  
There is no picture taking inside the poll site.  This is BOE's policy.  The only exception is for the press.  Please don't hate me, I don't make the rules, just enforce them for everyone.",0

March in support of music workers, preserve our culture 

Live music is a cornerstone of NYC culture. Right now there is no plan for live music. Government officials have prevented musicians from playing, even as venues are opening and taking customers. Music advertisements were banned by SLA. 1099 gig workers are in danger of losing unemployment benefits. Grants are few. Digital music is undervalued. No Broadway, no symphony, no cruise ships, no wedding bands. No TOURS! Even selling merch is difficult now. 

Musicians are hurting, many having to leave the city where they built their lives and careers, in pursuit of work elsewhere. 

Marching for musicians is also marching for venues, box office workers, security staff, production crews, sound engineers, managers, road managers, bookers, arts administrators, club managers, servers &amp; bartenders... the list goes on... Live music is the lifeblood of a whole ecosystem of jobs, and the foundation for a priceless culture that enriches our lives day to day. 

We need a path forward for this industry and the multitudes of people involved.",0

"I've just gone through a housing search and dodged a bullet thanks to [whoownswhat.justfix.nyc](http://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc)

They index not just the owner and manager of every building in NYC, but they also provide information on what other buildings they own and also provide a breakdown of how many open HPD violations they across all of their buildings. From what I can tell, not a lot of folks know about this site, so thought I'd pass along the word to anybody else doing a housing search.

I nearly moved into 13 Essex in Chinatown/LES recently and after a few things set off my sketch-radar, I  looked them up on justfix. Their record was abysmal.

"Choices that my parents made as 1st generation Asian immigrants by taking out loans and sacrificing:  


""Don't talk to strangers and go read books while I shop."" I remember when I was in my early teens, in the summer, my mom would drop me off at Barnes and Noble or any local public library and make me do SAT prep or do work books on a separate notebook for 4-12 hours. I would be there from 10am to 11pm sometimes. This allowed my mom to save money from babysitting and use it to increase our education.

I remember when I was in grade school, we went to Korean/Christian school on Saturday and Church on Sunday. The school part was some classes but it was primarily a babysitting service for kids. We also participated in Kumon during gradeschool, which is an Asian business that provides extra math and english worksheets to complete to solidify math and english skills.

In highschool, we were also sent to Korean Saturday schools that hired regular teachers to teach more english and math. My mom signed me up to a Kaplan's SAT course and another private SAT prep course class run by Koreans. My mom also hired us an SAT prep teacher and tutors. I remember in highschool, she looked around in many towns to look for free tutors. When she found it, she drove us back and forth for free tutoring. I remember this also happening in public libraries. There were programs where college students and seniors in highschool tutored 7-8th graders. My schedule in highschool was school, do hw, eat dinner, study until sleep at 11pm.

My parents also paid for multiple instrument lessons, including violin and piano for the both of us, then band instruments for the both of us. My mom played the piano at church and taught piano privately to pay for most of these things. So much of our parents' income was used to make us better and they went into a lot of debt at times to give us these opportunities. They sacrificed their fun and their hobbies for us to have more. One of the biggest sacrifices they made was instead of buying a house in a lower middle class neighborhood that we lived in, according to our means, my mom basically forced my dad to move to a better neighborhood that he couldn't afford so that we could get a better education. We moved to an upper middle class whose houses ranged from 400k to 1.4 million in 2004. Instead of paying mortgage in a more affordable area, they decided to rent in an upper middle class purely for our education. The public highschool we attended was top 30 in our state.

I would argue that a certain percentage of Koreans study 4-40 hours (average is 4-7 hours probably, but I was forced to study for 20-40 hours a week in highschool after school) a week more on average than most Americans. This is the to me one of the biggest factors. The ironic thing is, the amount Korean-Americans study is still not as much as Koreans and Japanese do in their countries on average. In south Korea, it isn't uncommon for lower class parents to work extra to pay for extra tutoring or extra classes at private businesses for their kid's future.

I think all these values allow Asians to do well in whatever they do. Of course not every family is like this, as Koreans whose families have been here for many generations seem to liberalize and Americanize, but this is why children of Asian immigrants do so well. Also every culture is different in different ways in Asia. And I've also noticed in every country, there's responsible culture and irresponsible culture- 2 different ways of living. The type of Koreans who immigrate to the US also happen to be Christian. I don't know if you've seen the Office but they make fun of this with the Korean van that picks up Koreans from parts of Scranton to bring to the church. We had this in our area where I grew up too.

Also Koreans and I think Haitians have started their own radio stations in certain areas like NY/NJ. They translate local and national American news to Korean. This serves as a information network, which along with parents gossiping helps a lot of useful information to spread quickly.

These are the sacrifices and choices that certain asian families seem to make. I can extrapolate on anything if you need me to.

To hear this called privilege by the left is pretty offensive and insulting to my parents and grandparents who sacrificed so much free time and hobbies and money and energy to provide me with a better life. The fact that asians have to score 250 points higher on the SAT's never mind padding their extracurriculars, is punishment for hard work and good decision making. Also the 20-30 hours a week of time I studied at home. I remember my mom telling me, ""In the US, Asians have to score higher on the SATS, so you have to work harder than other people. This is reality.""

Now can you tell me on average Americans and other groups make this level of sacrifice for education? Where they spend all their extra income to sacrifice for their kid's education?",0
"Choices that my parents made as 1st generation Asian immigrants by taking out loans and sacrificing:

First, they came here, and left me, a newborn with their parents in their home country. They came to NYC, got minimum wage jobs, worked and saved money until they became stable. A year and a half later, they had my sister. Due to this, my parents waited a few more years I was 5 years old to send for me. Huge sacrifices already.

""Don't talk to strangers and go read books while I shop.""

In south Korea, it isn't uncommon for lower class parents to work extra to pay for extra tutoring or extra classes at private businesses for their kid's future. Unfortunately, South Korea and Japan have some of the highest suicide rates in developed countries and this amount of stress can also have far reaching consequences. 

Also Koreans and I think Haitians have started their own radio stations in certain areas like NY/NJ. They translate local and national American news to Korean. This serves as a information network, which along with parents gossiping helps a lot of useful information to spread quickly. 

These are the sacrifices and choices that certain asian families seem to make. My Indian friend, told me how his mom has had the same clothes for years, to save money for their mortgage or to help with his tutoring or college fees. I can extrapolate on anything if you need me to. 

Now can you tell me on average Americans and other groups make this level of sacrifice for education? Where they spend all their extra income to sacrifice for their kid's education?  


Another example: In my home country, my grandfather wanted his 4 children to be educated. He was born in 1935. He took out loans to pay for his children's college education. Due to his low income, it took him until 2010 to pay it off. He had to save money by penny pinching and refused to buy meat for a long time to save up the money to pay it off.   


To hear this called privilege by the left and somehow insinuated that this is due to white people giving us privilege is pretty offensive and insulting to my parents and grandparents who sacrificed so much free time and hobbies and money and energy to provide me with a better life. The fact that asians have to score 250 points higher on the SAT's never mind padding their extracurriculars, is punishment for hard work, time invested, delayed gratification, good decision making. Such as the extra 20-30 hours a week of time I studied at home. I remember my mom telling me, ""In the US, Asians have to score higher on the SATS, so you have to work harder than other people.

" I'm wondering what I can do in this situation:

Moved out at the end of July. Landlord is withholding a good amount of security deposit for damages that were there when I moved in. Had pictures of a lot of it but is still withholding for generic ""wall damage"" and ""not cleaning"". There was small nails/ holes in the wall when I moved in where old tenant hung pictures. I spend 6 hours scrubbing the place down and left it much much cleaner than when I moved in. The landlord also had violated many health codes refusing to deal with mice which ate all my bedding/furniture ect despite asking for 6 months to fix it. Maybe all the mice made it dirty again before they inspected.

I'm trying to figure out what the best law to go after them with. I'm thinking the security deposit return timing is cut and dry.

I read some laws that the landlord has to repay the security deposit in 14 days along with a list of deductions. Mine made the check out 25 days later and refused to give an itemized list until multiple emails which ended up being 1.5 months later. Am I correct in saying they have no right to withhold anything now? I'm basing the argument on this link
https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GOB/7-108

Also I had to let them know I couldn't renew a little less than a month beforehand. There is nothing in the lease and I couldn't find a law saying I had to give more notice. Is there a law I couldn't find?

They had agreed to give a small amount more back but its been a month more and no response or check. I said thank you for giving more back but will require the full deposit back (and then went into reasons). I have not brought up laws yet or threatened litigation.

Any advice in how to proceed would be great.",0

"I decided to ride my bike from FiDi to Upper West Side today to see a friend.

I rode for a while, and the amount of for lease signs in every single neighborhood and almost every single block frankly jarred me.

Boarded up businesses. Mom and pop shops. Chains. Restaurants, cleaners, empty storeforents. You name it. 

For me, it was a painful reminded of what Covid has taken away, besides the lives and health of many. 

NYC will bounce back. But we have a long way to go. But this is just really depressing, because behind those close businesses are jobs, and people, and families that had it all taken away from them in a flash.",0

"Tattooed folks and tattoo artists of Astoria/NYC! I'm raising money for sick kids through Extra Life this year and have raised over $6000 in support of Children's Miracle Network and Cohen's Children Medical Center (in NY).

I had set up a bunch of incentives (like getting waxed live on stream) to help raise money. One of my coworkers donated $1000 (plus an additional $1000 to be matched by our company) on the condition I get a Papa Smurf tattoo.

Ideally I would love to do this live on stream as part of the fundraiser! I'm looking to get Papa Smurf in a ""Fighting Irish"" pose - I'm thinking about 2-4 inches tall. Haven't decided where yet, probably my leg or my butt.

If anyone knows of someone who would be willing to do a house call and willing to let me stream this on the afternoon or evening of Saturday, November 7th - that would be amazing.

NOT A REQUIREMENT: Ideally I'd love it if we could crowd-source the artist's usual rate and donate that to the cause in lieu of the normal fee (I would of course still be giving a sizeable tip). That said, I understand its a really difficult time for a lot of artists and I'm happy to pay full price for this.

This is a really amazing cause, and any help achieving this goal of doing the tattoo live on stream would be so wonderful.

Of course, I'm happy to share a link to the page which includes evidence of the donation and request.

To anyone who's interested in donating, please message me for the link (I'm not posting publicly just for privacy reasons).

"Long story short, I lost almost everything because of the pandemic in New York, no job, no income so I just started a small business selling handcrafted snack. I can't afford to open a store (you know that crazy NYC retail rental rate) so I made an online shop first. Hope things get well, I can only sell and ship within New York States now because of Home Processing regulation. The snack I make is a nougat-like snack in bite-size, made from various nuts, milk, biscuits, and dried fruits. I have been selling for a while now offline to friends and family and they totally love it, a lot of them return for more, I really believe this could be big, maybe something like Baked by Melissa or Lady M.

Anyway, I got nowhere else to talk about this, I lived in NYC for almost 20 years and started this here. Feels like it may fit in this subreddit. I don't want this post removed so I am not going to post anything such as a link or name related to my business to avoid being viewed as spam or ad post. I hope one day I can open a small shop in the city for everyone to enjoy it and become a brand that started out from NYC, then I will come back to read this post again to witness the birth of a brand. Any advice are welcomed, I feel like in NYC anything is possible!

"So I did this once before in NH, and the NH DMV issued me this thick paper temporary plate to put in my dash while I drove my private party purchased car from NH to NY.

"First, let me say for the most part I don't think NYC is, or will, look like it did in the 70s and 80s. That said, today I had a moment where I was like ""ooh...ok I can see it""


I'm rent stabilized, grew up in my apartment, know the building like it's a good buddy. Right now there are 11 empty units out of 20. Of those 9 occupied apartments, 6 are also rent stabilized. Same deal as me, people who have lived there forever. The 3 market tenants seem to buzz everyone into the building willy nilly. 


Today I heard some commotion in the hallway so I run my ass down to see what was going on. I found my super banging on one of the empty apartments - he told me someone had been squatting in it. Kind of makes sense because I had noticed some odd things but assumed new tenants moved in.


I actually like my super so I joined him in the door bang. Eventually some dude came out with all his shit and told us he was ""waiting for his broker"" - we had a good laugh at that and told him to fuck off.


My super then tells me this is the second squatter they've had in the empty units in a few months. I remember a couple weeks ago someone rattled my door handle, but they boogied when I asked who it was. 


Super tells me it's happened in his other building, too. People know these apartments are empty and are trying to sleep in them. I tell him that sucks, remind him he said he'd re-caulk my moldy bathtub a month ago and end it there. 


That SAME night, I hear someone in the hallway on a floor that I know is empty. Low and behold, another guy is going door to door, checking to see if any are locked or have shitty locks (as these new doors all seem to). I yelled at him and he left.


In short: THIS feels like the late 80s and early 90s. I only had to deal with squatters as a kid. The only difference is back then, they were all doing heroin.


MORAL OF THE STORY: Lock your doors and stop buzzing people into your fucking building if you don't know who they are. 


If they say ""FEDEX"" don't be lazy, go check. 


If your gut tells you they are bullshitting you, they are. Don't let them in.",0
"Walking around in a chain drug store earlier this week, I see this guy at the refrigerated shelf in the back of the store, just grabbing one after another bottle of something and stuffing them into his sizable backpack. 

I only really saw him grab one or two, he was probably finishing up, so I don't know how many he had exactly in his bag. He had a mask and sunglasses on, so I don't know what he looked like, but he was a big, 20-something white guy, definitely not yuppie, a little rough-looking with a hand tattoo. 

I didn't really give it much though, people shop with their own bags all the time. But he had a nervous energy and didn't even stop to let me pass, and I had to double back to get to the other aisle. 

He finishes up and starts quickly walking towards the register, where there's a huge crowd. I'm curious, so I go look at the shelf he was at. It's empty. It used to hold Odwalla juices at about $4 each and there's not one bottle left. I watch him, and he walks around the crowd, past the guard, and out of the store.

Well, there goes my assuming the best in people. 

So first, I wasn't going to stop or question him because I didn't think he was doing anything wrong. But admittedly, I might have rationalized that because he was big, rough-looking and a little threatening-looking to me. 

Then again, what could I have done? He hadn't done anything wrong until he walked out of the shop.

But as my suspicion of shoplifting grew, I also thought, what can I do, scream after him? For what could be three Odwallas? Until he left the shop, he could have just quickly turned to another shelf and made like he was browsing. 

Besides, what he had in his bag was perishable, it's not like he was loading up on batteries or pseudoephedrine and this is a chain store with margins to account for shrink, not some mom-and-pop place.

I hear a lot about how retail folks, even guards, aren't supposed to stop people anyway. Why make myself a target to call out some potentially dangerous? I don't blend in easily and this is my neighborhood, where people can find me. 

Then I thought, even though this is a chain store, there are employees behind it, and they may suffer because of something like this. Shoplifting raises prices for everyone. 

And I don't want New York to become a lawless place where criminals do as they wish. I also thought he might have grabbed those Odwallas to resell to a dishonest retailer in the neighborhood in return for cash.

I'm not sure how to feel about this whole experience. I don't feel too guilty for letting it pass, but I hate to keep silent when people do wrong as well. What do you think? What would you do? Is there more I can or should do?

Should I have contacted the drug store then or even after, to let them know what I saw?",0

"Those violations. But here is the thing, I haven't owned that car for the last 5-6 years due to the fact it was booted, towed, then sold. The license plate number is surely not on file anymore. And I still owe that $363 in order to get my license again. So here's the other thing, I still have my title with the color, make/model, license plate number on it. And now both the tickets that say I owe 'x' amounts for have completely different license plate numbers attached to them and one of them I'm able to view the ticket and it says that my car was a red Nissan, and my car was a blue Mercury Sable LS. The license plate number on either of the tickets does not match. The color, make/model on the one ticket I can see does not match either. And both of the license plate numbers on both ticket are different themselves, so one ticket had one plate number while the other had a different plate number.

"Hi everyone,

I've been applying for jobs lately (Marketing Coordinator) and I'm getting calls back within a day or two and 3 different companies have expressed interest in in-person interviews. 

Am I the only one who thinks they're tripping? I don't understand why a Zoom call wouldn't be superior in every single aspect in the current circumstances, there's literally no need for an in-person. 

Are these companies to be trusted? Is this normal to see such a quick turnaround but lack of concern for safety? Seems sus. Also are office people just transitioning back almost normally now?",0

"Not to sound like an alarmist but it's great so many dogs and cats are being adopted but my greatest fear is that when things go to somewhat normal, people who adopted animals to help them shelter in, will return their family member to a shelter.

I have a friend who volunteers at a shelter and they are even preparing for this reality to happen. How someone could do that to an animal to me is heartless.

 As a longtime dog owner when people see me walking my dogs on warm summer days, they report that they would like to get a dog. I always tell them to wait until it's Winter when it's cold and snowy outside and see if you feel the same way.

Also you're agreeing to give up sleeping in one the weekends, once you return to work, running home to let the dog out, planning your vacation around your dog as you find where to take them while you're gone and finally a realization that vets are costly,

New post that isn't fueled *as much* with scotch and sleep deprivation as the previous, so should be a bit more coherent and easier to understand.

No TL;DR cause fuck you. I'm giving out free fucking groceries. Read the fucking post. 

I put up a post and surprisingly didn't receive *any* PMs requesting groceries, so here I am again. 

# I am aiming to provide 70 households from Reddit within NYC with the options of:

A) Ten lbs. of drumsticks  
B) Eight lbs. of quarter chicken legs *or*  
C) Six and a half lbs. of drum sticks with a dozen eggs

Ideal candidates are those that are unable to eat the free food provided by the city due to food sensitivity, conflicts of religion, culture, health reasons, etc.^(1) This is aimed to help those that are seriously in need of assistance, with a heavy preference given to the elderly, young students, immigrants, folks that don't quality for any or limited assistance, etc. Communities that have historically been disfranchised, you get the idea. Families that have children enrolled in NYC public schools should be receiving $420/child/month for food^(2). If the aid is still not enough, I'm your guy. While this is geared towards Redditors, if you know someone that isn't on Reddit but is also really struggling, shoot me a PM with their info. This is going by honor code for everyone, so square up with your maker on your own time. 

# If you're trying to get groceries, send me a PM with the title ""Groceries, *insert borough, insert neighborhood, insert which option*""

In order for this to work, I'm going to ask for some assistance from the Reddit community. Due to the limited space of our shop, I am not going to have folks congregate at the business trying to pick up their orders. That being said, I need a couple of Redditors with the means come and pick up the bulk orders, however many of which type that will be, and prepare and segregate the orders off premise. Logistically, this means: 

\- Someone/s with a vehicle to accommodate and transport  
o 700lbs of drums, *or*  
o 560lbs of quarter chicken legs, *or*   
o 455lbs of drums and 70 dozen eggs, *or*  
o *Most likely* some combination of all three  
\- A clean space/location to prepare these orders, ideally commercial   
\- Folks who have a food handling certificate to prepare the orders  
\- Someone/s with a vehicle to accommodate and deliver the orders to whoever needs them 

I am asking for volunteers and free labor because I'm broke as shit and I'm unable to make this happen on my own, within my own means, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for assistance in the first place. Volunteers will be provided face masks. 

If you‚Äôre a MVP and trying to help me out with the pick up, splitting and bagging, delivering, etc., PM with the title ***Grocery Help, Driver/Location/Food handling*** (choose whatever role you can fulfill)

I would like to continue being able to do this, so shameless plug: our Venmo is still the same and hasn‚Äôt changed @ FourSevenDivisionStreetTrading.

"I've lived in NYC for 6 years, and got a cheap used car last month. It's been an amazing way for my wife and I to 1) get out of the city easily for short trips, and 2) use during times I don't feel like taking public transit because of difficult circumstances.

Some details: I live in Morningside Heights, and only do street parking. In the past month, it has taken max an hour to find a spot, and usually it takes about 5-10 minutes if I do it during the right time of day/week. The alternate side parking reform has also made this process significantly less stressful, as long as I'm vigilant during the hour and a half period I have to get a new spot.

Riverside drive is also an absolute godsend for finding a free spot in my area. There's just so much street parking there that you almost always find at least one spot every time I need one.

I'm posting this for those that might be considering getting a car but can't afford a garage fee, or are seeing the strong negative opinion/experience most people share about it. If you stroll your neighborhood, take a look around and see if there's commonly a spot or two available in your vicinity on weekday afternoons. If so, that's probably a good sign that street parking is viable and worth pursuing long term. Having a car in NYC can be a great experience during these times - this may change for me but so far I love it.

In the past moonth, I've used the car to: 1) Visit parents in NJ twice, 2) Go camping, 3) Drive to CT for a small get together, 4) Take my cat to the vet for an emergency appointment, 5) Get some free furniture off of Craigslist, and 6) Get my wife down to Times Square for an appointment she was late to.

An important Hasidic wedding scheduled for Monday in Williamsburg could be a big test of the resolve of state and city officials to enforce infection reducing lockdown rules to keep [COVID-19](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/covid-19/) clusters in check.

As CBS2‚Äôs political reporter Marcia Kramer reports, New York City is hoping to avoid a repeat of a gathering last Sunday in the village of New Square, Rockland County, where thousands of Orthodox Jews thumbed their noses at social distancing and mask rules enacted by the state.

The gathering could be responsible for a new spike in infection rates. According to [Gov. Andrew Cuomo](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/andrew-cuomo) the positive test rate in Rockland County red zones ‚Äì including New Square ‚Äì was 11.26% Thursday ‚Äî up from 8.40% the day before.

‚ÄúSome of the complexity of the enforcement here, especially with members of the Orthodox community, they never comply with the rules,‚Äù Cuomo said.

New York City official hope to avoid d√©j√† vu all over again on Monday in Williamsburg where, according to flyers obtained by CBS2 the grandchild of Satmar Grand Rebbe Zalman Leib Teitlebaum is scheduled to be married. The worry is that the wedding, with events scheduled at 152 Rodney Street and 590 Bedford Street could draw thousands, not only from Williamburg, but from the Satmar community in Rockland County.

The positive rest rate in the Brookyn red zones also rose. Thursday it was 5.47%, up from 4.75% the day before.

Although the wedding venues are not in any of the [COVID](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/covid-19/) mini-cluster zones, officials are still worried about the spread of infection.

‚ÄúCity Hall is in discussions with the state on issuing the proper guidance. Large gatherings without social distancing and masks are severe public health risks and all guidance will be enforced. We are looking for community cooperation and hope to see all public health guidelines followed,‚Äù said [Mayor Bill de Blasio](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/bill-de-blasio)‚Äòs Press Secretary Bill Neidhardt.

Sources say officials are trying to get the Satmar community to limit the number of people at the indoor ceremony. The concern is how many show up outside and whether it will require a large contingent of police.

On Saturday, Kramer learned authorities served an order to the Congregation Yetev Lev D‚ÄôSatmar to cancel or postpone the wedding if it is not limited to 50 people.",0

I'm Meisner trained, in sag, have a few low level agents and a low level manager, I get really awesome auditions (when I get them) but I'm finally starting to notice some small hints of progress after doing this for a few years now. (like a tape I had for an office last week, I read for them for the 1st time 13 months ago). I've since branched out into filmmaking and just submitted my first short I wrote/directed/produced that I'm pretty proud of to film festivals. I also have some experience in development, pitching to producers and agents, etc. I feel like for me I have way more experience than I give myself credit for, and it's really just about finding the right people to build my team / collaborate with, then just being patient and putting one foot in front of the other until I achieve my goals. I've had a couple pins for co-stars on network shows and my first call back last year, I know I'm circling the drain of landing my first tv credit, which is exciting.

but yeah, I'm really interested in meeting other actors to be friends with and maybe help each other out with self tapes, or other writer/producers to collaborate and produce something together, or anybody that works in any facet of the industry, we can exchange instagrams or something! I'm really trying to develop a large network of people that helps each other out on projects and lifting each other up to the next level!

"**ALASKA FOOD MARKET** on 17th Street x 9th. Chelsea.

This place down on my corner is absurd. I understand that there's probably a considerable amount of overhead to run a grill during the day and operate 24 hours against larger corporate stores, especially during a pandemic. I don't ever get upset if I'm overcharged a bit if I decide to buy a 12-pack at a bodega but even if you are in competition, I despise shady business techniques.

1. Insanely overpriced in general on any given item, as if they took the tags at another store and slapped an extra $2 on it. Almost smug how they do it.
2. If you buy more than ONE item, the owner will quickly shuffle it all into a plastic bag and charge you for the bag (maybe I should have been more perceptive about him bagging my shit but it's one of those things you don't even think about if they don't ask). I didn't even know these stores had plastic bags in stock still.
3. He gives you customer itemized receipts and if you pay with card, he throws in a random percentage charge. I've heard of cash discounts but not card upcharges.

If you're familiar with this stretch of 9th Ave, there is an abundance of reasonably priced bodegas with very friendly owners. I only go here on last resort. Why is this guy still in business?

Anyway, on to my dispute reasoning

1. Its a handwritten ticket, and one of the numbers/letters on the license plate section is completely illegible (most of the handwriting is very sloppy honestly)

2. I've seen countless people park where I've parked with no tickets, and the arrows are fairly confusing as the 'no standing' sign could very easily be pointing towards the fire hydrant which so many people park next to (which is what I thought) 

3. There's no yellow paint. Well, unless you look really *really* hard -- and even then it's faded to hell. 

4. I tried to pay it already, but of course since it's handwritten it's not even in the system yet. I know these things take time but, I figured that was worth adding.

Any advice is much appreciated",0

- Negotiate a full price realtor down (3-4%?)
- Redfin (~2-4% depending on buyers agent)

At the time I lived just outside Coolidge Corner, partway up the hill, about 3 miles from Fenway Park.  It was after the leaves had mostly fallen off the trees.  I lived on the 2nd floor, so I could see over the buildings on the other side of the street.

It was dark, and I didn't have the lights on, I was just looking at the city.  Then I noticed a disk glowing in the sky, near Fenway.  It was like looking at a plate from above, not on edge.

It was moving slowly.  Eventually, it started changing, as it turned. &gt;! It was the Metlife Blimp (white, with Snoopy on the side).  It was exactly at my eye level, which is why it looked so funny.  Since it was dark, you couldn't see the people pod under the blimp.!&lt;

"Just wanted to recommend this charity in case anyone is looking to give this holiday season.

"Hi all,

I'll go ahead and apologize in advance for probably another redundant ""I'm moving to Boston please help"" post. I've looked through the subreddit on recent moving posts and while most were helpful, I still have some questions and am looking for advice in a few areas. 

Backstory is that I (28M) just accepted a job with one of the local hospitals located between Fenway and Mission Hill and will be looking to move from Memphis TN to Boston with my wife probably around early January. My wife will continue to work remotely with her currently employer as we move while she tries to find new employment locally. All in our household income will be around $142K annually. 

A lot of the questions I have center around moving, locating housing, and just daily living in Boston. 

1. The first question I have is around neighborhood suggestions. We would like to live somewhere relatively close to where I will be working which is around Dana-Farber, Brigham and Women's, Boston Children's campus. Being able to access work by either a bike ride or a quick hop on the T would be most ideal. Looking for a 2bd apartment somewhere between $2.5-3k/month.  Some of the neighborhoods that we've been looking at have been Fenway, Mission Hill, Allston, and Brookline. From what I can see I think our price range and what we're looking for is pretty spot on for the areas, but I guess I'm just looking to see if there is anyone here who can comment on the neighborhoods themselves. We like to live fairly social lives (as much as we can these days) so it would be nice to live in a fairly vibrant neighborhood.  
2. From what I've read online and the research I've done it seems like that it's pretty common to go through a broker when finding an apartment. Having lived my entire adult life primarily in the south, this isn't really something I'm accustomed with. I've heard some horror stories with some scummy brokers that look to take advantage of people and obviously I'd like to avoid this. Any advice in locating a trustworthy broker? I know that there are some apartment listings on craigslist that can bypass the broker situation but I'm not sure if this recommended or not. 
3. Anyone that has spent any time in the south knows that it's a pretty car-centric culture. Can't really get anywhere without one as public transit is usually pretty limited. My wife and I both have cars and have debated whether we'll need both of them. I know parking can not only be pretty limited in Boston but also incredibly expensive. Any thoughts on ditching one of or both of the vehicles? I do have family within driving distance of Boston so I think having at least one would be nice. 
4. If there is any other advice or general things to keep in mind about living in Boston I would love to hear it. We've visited the city several times in the past and we absolutely love it, but visiting the city and actually living there are two different stories. Having lived the past few years in Memphis I am very much looking forward to a change of scenery, but I know it will be pretty different culture wise. 

Thanks!",1

"My boyfriend (26M) and I (25F) are looking into moving to Boston in March. He is currently on awaiting a decision from a company and I wanted to gather some info before we make a final decision. We are currently living in Houston, TX for the last 5 years. I am from CT and he is from NJ so we are familiar with New England weather and culture. Neither of us have ever been to Boston though so we are unsure on exactly where to look. 

What would be some neighborhoods to check out? We are looking for a 1-2 bedroom apartment under $2200/month, the lower the better without compromising total security. His job will be located by the prudential center in Back Bay. We do have two dogs so a nearby park would be a huge plus! Anywhere within a 45 minute commute would be ideal for us, we each have cars so we would not need public transportation.

"The area I usually park at is taken by Netflix for some production for 24 hours during 12/1. So I was looking at other streets to park at in my neighborhood (Boston Chinatown).

"Hi all! I used to have a backyard where I composted in a spinning bin. I'm moving to a condo in Brighton that has an enclosed yard that only the condo residents can use that is now mostly used for the residents to walk their dogs.

Where can one donate non-food related items for the less fortunate/ homeless... like Blankets, socks, diapers, pads etc? Also, I am open to other needed items if someone can suggest.

Any suggestions appreciated for organizations/ places... in around Boston/ Greater Boston area? I want to make sure that the donated items go to right person in need.  

Thank you in advance.",1

"Hello r/boston, my girlfriend, our two cats and I just recently moved here from Georgia. We wanted to move somewhere more connected that actually has 4 seasons. As an EE grad. I wanted to go somewhere with a tech scene and since she wants to do illustration I think there's art stuff here for her too. Regardless of the reasons, we've moved here and want to be able to actually go into and experience living here. 

I know there are plenty of posts here already to help people with finding a place to live and I've read the ones on the sidebar as well as others that I searched for. The problem is just that there's just so much to know. There are so many small areas and towns and I'm honestly feeling overwhelmed trying to figure out a good area to stay, it feels like I'm overlooking so much and won't even realize it for a while. That mixed with the pressure of paying for a hotel, dwindling funds and working full time is why I'm making my own post for advice. We're hoping to figure this out sooner rather than later and I'm hoping you guys can serve as a sanity check for our plan or suggest a better one. 

We want to be close enough to go into the city and actually experience living here but at the same time our jobs are in burlington. I have a car but once we get an apartment we were gonna find new (hopefully better) jobs closer to where we end up staying. My girlfriend is adamant about avoiding shared spaces because of the cats as well as because of previous bad experiences she's had. 

Together, with our $13/hour jobs we think we can afford about $1500/mo for rent. We were thinking of a 1br. apartment. A second bedroom would always be nice for the cats stuff or for if I could convince any of our good friends to move up and live with us to split rent, but I realize that isn't really going to be possible so were really just looking at 1 room. Her mom and my dad are both willing to cosign and we have good credit so I think we can get past the whole 3x-5x rent requirements a lot of places have. 

So considering all of that, we were looking at medford. I think it has good T access and is closer to everything while still not being too far from our current place of work. I think it'll give us a good place to find new jobs and still be centrally located. Although, like I mentioned, I'm sure there's plenty of stuff I'm missing out on here that we'll learn eventually. 

So I've got three questions. 
* Does our plan sound very feasible? 
* Do you all know any apartments for rent? 
* Do you guys have better suggestions?",1
"No body in the Bible celebrated a day called thanksgiving. People do not even know who God is. They are more interested in eating a turkey. People are really praying to the Devil. If your prayers were so right then why can't the people of this world pray to God and stop the virus?

The people know that their prayers are not heard. So praying over a dead bird is not going to help get your prayer answered. Being for real and sincere would help you.

How  can the turkeys all be white? The Devil is behind this whole thing that he set up about travelling long distances to sit down and eat a turkey which is white. The Devil manipulated the growing of turkeys to make them white. A white turkey could  not live in the wild. It would be shot on sight. When Jesus made the animals he made them so they would have a covering that would protect them. Like the deer who blend in. The birds blend in with the environment.

But the Devil had set it up to be a  white bird. It's a sign of a lie. This whole thing revolves around a dead bird on a platter and the Devil says ""Do it"" and they do it. They are showing they are obedient to the Devil's words. So you can see that the whole country is obedient to what the Devil wants. Yet they will not obey God's Word - they won't even study God's Word. They rather believe the lies that the phony ministers teach which is not according to the Word of God.",1
Does anyone have suggestions for good gyms in or really close to beacon hill? Or are there apartment/condo buildings that have gyms you can become a member at or even MGH for example?,1
"I'm strongly considering just paying the tax penalty for not having insurance in 2021, I'm just finding it harder and harder to justify these prices. For the record [here is a comparison](https://i.imgur.com/iolNIop.png) between my current 2020 plan (left) and the corresponding 2021 plan. The premium remains mostly unchanged at $375, deductible is about the same, but the copays are pretty much all doubling or more?

So basically they want $4500 upfront, then they won't help at all with the first $3600. And even after I've paid $8100 they STILL expect me to pay $100+ to see a doctor, $1k to get an MRI, $1750 to go to the ER? wtf is the premium and the deductible for then?

And this is among the cheapest plans available. The only cheaper one listed only lets you go to their specific doctor basically, which won't work for me. And then if you want one of the ""better"" plans without the high deductible, the premiums are $8k+ anyway, so it's no different than just getting the cheap one and paying the deductible up front.

So what are the rest of you guys doing? Is this a normal amount to be paying? The max penalty for not having coverage is $1200 I think, so even if I pay that, it still leaves me with an extra $5900 to pay for any doctor visit out of pocket no?",1

**Charlie's Monologue**

- We are announcing a new public awareness campaign
- Massachusetts continues to be a national leader in access to COVID testing
- Thanksgiving represents a big potential risk for the spread of COVID-19, just as it was in Canada back in October.
    - Celebrate only with your household
    - If you do anything more than that (not recommended), keep it as short as possible and wear masks the whole time.
    - The state limit on indoor gatherings is 10 people.
    - College students need to receive a test before they leave campus. This is not just a Massachusetts rule.
    - Don't share food or drink, and open windows to allow for ventilation
    - Older people and those with pre-existing conditions are most affected by COVID.
    - If you plan to spend time with these people, take the proper precautions.
    - Do everything you can to keep things small..
    - Larger gatherings are simply not worth the risk.
    - mass.gov/thanksgiving2020 has more information
- The biggest single driver of spread these days in Massachusetts is household spread.
    - [I can't speak to the specifics of how the virus is spread in Massachusetts, but [that statement is not supported by evidence nation-wide](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/health/coronavirus-holiday-gatherings.html).]
- Many people who catch COVID will not have symptoms, or will have relatively light symptoms. So just because you don't feel sick doesn't mean you definitively don't have COVID.
- We are setting up at least one field hospital to support a surge of new COVID patients.
- There is hope on the horizon for vaccines, but right now COVID is a huge risk.
- We are launching a public awareness campaign called #getbackmass
    - ""It's a reminder that we must continue to fight so we can get back to the things we love to do.""
    - The campaign includes billboards, and TV and digital ads that will run through February.
    - We've been using a variety of channels to inform individuals throughout Massachusetts of our COVID policies, including the #maskupma campaign this past summer.
    - This campaign makes it clear that we'll be able to get back to the things we want to do if we (1) wear facemasks, (2) socially distance, and (3) get tested.

**Secretary Sudders's monologue**

- For the new campaign, we surveyed 1,000 people about their COVID-related behavior and how they reacted to specific motivators and messages
    - Based on the research, we classified people as ""COVID-cautious people"" (52%) or ""life-is-normal people"" (48%).
    - The most receptive messages were ones that indicated concern for the health/safety of loved ones, including above the health/safety of the people surveyed themselves.
- We are extending the Abbot BinaxNow testing program from K-12 to including long-term care facilities
    - They will be used to test people entering the facility who aren't part of the population or regular staff
    - You will not be allowed to enter the facility if you test positive
    - These tests should not be used for large-scale testing of all residents.
- Long term care facilities will now be doing weekly testing of all staff (up from every other week).
    - Additionally, facilities should test all residents and staff if there is a positive case reported from the facility.
    - The state continues to support surveillance testing costs for these facilities
- We announced $650K of grants for 20 faith and community organizations to reduce spread and increase awareness of COVID in communities of color in the hardest-hit towns.
- The COVID dashboard report that would normally be published this Thursday will instead be published on Friday.

**Questions for Charlie**

Reporter: According to the TSA, the volume of travelers in airports across the US is about 40% of what it was last year at this time. How frustrating is it to you that not everybody is listening to this message, even with a ""shiny new campaign""?

Charlie: The fact that travel data is down shows that our message has resonated with many people. We hope that even people who do travel are still following some of our guidance on mask wearing, social distancing, etc. 

R: What is Thanksgiving going to look like at the Baker household?

C: Our immediate family will be attending. I'll try to visit my dad at some point.

R: What is the plan in two weeks, assuming that a lot of people are traveling for Thanksgiving?

C: We obviously can't predict exactly what's going to happen in two weeks. We'll continue to look at the data. Over the weekend, we saw a dip in the number of people who are hospitalized with COVID, which is unusual for a weekend.

R: Do you have plans to open up new testing sites, given the long lines reported?

C: We have 250 testing sites in MA, not just the stop the spread sites. If you have insurance, you can get tested (for the most part) with no cost to you at all. We're gonna do what we can to expand our testing infrastructure, but we're not sure yet if the current surge in testing is related to people wanting to be tested before traveling for Thanksgiving. We're not gonna know that until we have a few days worth of data.

R: Are the protocols safe enough for people to take advantage of good Friday [I think he meant black Friday]?

C: Retailers in MA are looking forward to that, since they've had such a difficult period during the pandemic. If you're going to shop online, you can do so with local retailers. There are very few retailers‚Äîincluding local retailers‚Äîwho don't sell online. If you are going to shop in person, make sure you follow the protocols set by the store. I would urge people to buy from Massachusetts-based companies if you're shopping online.

R: If the number of people taking tests continue to go up after Thanksgiving is over, is there a plan to increase lab capacity?

C: We anticipate that there will be additional capacity that will come online in mid-December.

R: If that doesn't solve a potential testing shortage, would there be a plan to ration tests like what was done in the spring?

C: Our goal is to have enough testing capacity to serve the people that are out there. There are billions of dollars in appropriated, but un-allocated, federal funds. This is a great example of why the current stalemate in Washington is such a problem. Just because its a lame-duck session doesn't mean people aren't still dealing with real-world problems.

R: You took part in a conference call with President-elect Biden last week. How are you feeling about an incoming administration? Are you encouraged that things will get better by January 20?

C: Kamala Harris was on that call too. I don't think we should be waiting until January 2020. There are a number of things that Washington needs to do before then, such as extending unemployment benefits. This would be a perfect time for congress to at least extend the agreements they already agreed on. I don't see why we would need to wait until January 20 for that to happen.

Additionally, vaccine distribution plans should definitely not wait until January 20. We already have a team in place in continual conversation with the feds. There needs to be a final review of the clinical trials, the addition of trials done by other companies, etc. Biden's transition team needs to be in contact and working with the white house task force that's been working on this for the last 10 months. The inability of these people at the federal level to get past the election will have seriously negative consequences for the people of this country.

R: Do you think Trump cares?

C: The president and his team needs to focus on what's directly in front of everybody in this country, which is COVID. Their second priority should be making sure that the transition goes as smooth as possible.

R: The forecast is calling for rain on Thursday for Thanksgiving, which might move people indoors. What enforcement would you like to see if people violate the indoor gathering limits?

C: We spend a lot of time talking to local governments about enforcement. Most of them are doing an ""appropriate"" form of enforcement, which entails telling people who are in big groups to simply go home, rather than fining people. But each community needs to handle it in a way that makes the most sense for them.

R: We are still hearing about people who are unemployed, whose benefits are still being held up. Should the state be assigning more people to this issue, and potentially update the numbers? [I didn't quite hear this question]

C: If someone is having an issue accessing the unemployment insurance system, they should reach out directly to the governor's office, and we'll follow up. Last week, there were 31,000 unemployment claims filed in MA, only 1,000 of which passed screening. There is an enormous problem with spammers trying to commit unemployment insurance fraud. This makes it very difficult to establish an accurate count. 

Additionally, there are many federal regulations that require unemployment insurance offices to make sure that they aren't paying money to people who don't exist or who aren't actually unemployed. This creates a ""time link"" for people who are actually entitled for unemployment benefits, where it can take some time to verify that they are legitimate.

R: Could you elaborate on the grant program?

Sudders: When the department of public health does large determination-of-need (DON) projects, we get new money specifically for community benefit programs, which is where this money is coming from. We tried to give this money to organizations with deep roots in their communities, that could reach people that aren't necessarily trusting of the government.

R: Can you give examples of how this money will be spent?

Sudders: We intentionally tried to not be too prescriptive with this money. We trust them to communicate to their communities awareness of COVID and how to protect themselves.

R: What does the vaccine rollout plan look like?

C: We currently process and distribute millions of vaccines per year. There is an existing infrastructure. With this vaccine, we need to ensure that the vaccine companies (1) ensure that they fully finish their clinical trials, (2) develop manufacturing protocols, and (3) begin manufacturing and distribution, with the idea that high-risk people will receive the vaccine first. We have a task force set up that communicates directly with the feds about what we need to do to follow through and deliver on the above points.

I don't want to put out hard numbers at this point because there are still a lot of unknowns, but we hope to begin vaccine distribution in early 2021 and ramp up for the first 5-6 months of 2021.

R: [Didn't quite hear this question, but it was related to vaccine distribution strategy.]

C: The big discussion is to focus distribution on healthcare workers, older individuals, and people with preexisting conditions, but that hasn't been fully decided yet.

R: Are you afraid that the pandemic is going to get worse before it gets better?

C: We pay the most attention to hospital capacity, which is currently at about 67% generally, and 48% in ICUs. In the spring, we missed a lot of cases because of test scarcity. There have been studies that we only found about 1 in 15 or 20 cases then. Now, its estimated that we find about 1 in 4 cases.

R: [Didn't hear, but I think he was asking about if the state was planning on changing the price it assigns to carbon emissions for setting climate policy.]

C: The transportation and climate initiative (TCI) was based on a set of assumptions about volume and congestion. Its possible that we'll be back to where we were at some point down the road. But at this point in time, we should re-examine the assumptions about what the impact would be of carbon reduction based on how transportation has changed in general. That's an important element for us and for the other states that are part of this initiative. We'll make a decision at the end of the year.

R: Cambridge is considering ending indoor dining. Thoughts?

C: Our policy has been to establish a statewide framework. We don't want towns to be more permissive than what our framework. However, we support towns' abilities to be more strict than what our guidelines allow for, if they feel it is necessary. However, (at this time) the statewide data does not imply a need to end indoor dining.",1

Time for another one of these posts...

I'm originally from Pittsburgh (been here a year) and during our family holidays we eat a ton of poppy seed roll. My family is a bunch of eastern europeans (pollocks and slavs). In Pittsburgh you can find it at almost every bakery and grocery store.

My family has chosen to stay apart for the holidays, but I'd really like to feel somewhat festive and eat delicious desserts. If anyone has a lead on poppy seed roll within a 2 hour drive (yeah I like it that much), that would be greatly appreciated. 

I've been unable to find it here, I've looked in Medford, Arlington, Woburn, Stoneham so far. 

Thanks a bunch",1

"Hi! Unfortunately Salem State University is actively harming my education and yours for next semester.

If you weren‚Äôt aware, Salem State raised fees already this year. They are being funded the usual amount. No other public higher education institution in Massachusetts has turned to furloughs.

"Hi all, I need to buy my first pair of snow boots ever (moved here from California in the summer) and need some advice from true Bostonians! I found a pair of snow boots with 100g insulation from Sorel that have great reviews and are in my budget. When I tried learning more about insulation, articles swore up and down that you need at least 200g if not 400g for snow boots in winter. 

I live downtown and work from home so don't plan to do any major trekking in these boots... Except for maybe the occasional snow day fun. Is 100g fine?",1

"The trains are different now, the tracks remain the same. 

The red line still goes from Alewife to Braintree, cutting the city in two. Red, empty veins, pumping only air. The blue line still courses to the airport, the occasional suitcase catching on a jagged chair leg. One fast pull and it‚Äôs free once more, quick. Efficient. Harsh. There‚Äôs no time now for mistakes. The green line still rumbles between empty college campuses, pausing for the occasional student to pass. Mask up, head down low. Trains pass by. No one enters.

The trains are empty now. 

Those who do enter the trains, do so with hurried purpose. They enter stiffly and quickly, choosing seats far from everyone else. A jammed workday commute is now only punctured by the occasional office worker with worried eyes. No one gripe the handrails. No one says a word. There‚Äôs no time to talk about the weather now, no time at all. 

One rider grips his Boston Globe tightly. He wants people to see he is reading it. But no one looks, no one cares enough to look. Not with everything else going on. He folds his paper. It falls discarded to the floor. 

The trains sound different now. The gentle rumble is now a roar, overwhelming even the most seasoned rider. ‚ÄúPay attention to me,‚Äù the trains yell. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so, so tired.‚Äù 

No one hears. No one can. 

The trains look different now. Cold, bright. Surgical. CDC advertisements plaster the walls. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù they caution. The trains disagree. ‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù they plead. 

And yet they hurry on, barreling through dark tunnels, under quiet city streets. 

The trains are different now: their destination, the same.",1

"Hi all! So basically I'm looking to move into Boston by 12/1/2020. I've gotten in touch with realtors (one from Gateway Real Estate Group, one from East Coast Realty), and there are two apartments that I like. 

The only issue is that it appears that both realtors want me to put down first month's rent before application approval and before signing a lease. This is so that I can ""hold down my spot"" apparently, which makes sense. From my digging online, it seems that this sometimes happens in Boston... but I'm just a little bit sketched out because I don't want to put down any money before any papers are signed. What's to stop them from taking the money and running? To make situations worse, one realtor is asking for payment via Venmo rather than credit/check, because my move-in date is apparently too soon to do credit/check. Paying via Venmo before a signed lease sounds like a trap to me.

So my questions is, is there any way for me to secure my first month's rent, even if they insist that I can't get a signed lease until I put money down? I'm asking them for a written contract stating that my deposit will be fully refunded in the event that my application isn't approved, but it looks like I'm getting a little pushback on that...

Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks so much. I just don't wanna get scammed!",1

And the folks that yell ""onedollaronedollaronedollar"" either did not have a mask on or took it down to perform their kulning.

Determined to get something out of this I keep wandering around the market while keeping a distance.

Luckily the driver of the Jeep was shaken but overall unharmed. The police came and took our statements as there were many witnesses. I believe that they are still looking for the mini van.

"For context: I'm fairly young and just started a new job, I work in the I.T industry and am hoping to move out of a crappy project development. 
Currently I am only a contract worker with no benefits but I just recently received good news from my manager (Who I have a great relationship with) that it's looking like I'll be getting a permeant position at the institute. This is huge for me considering one of the main reasons I haven't moved out of my mother's apartment is bc I haven't had a permeant job (Steady source of income) and have had fears of not being able to return once I jump ship. 

I was planning on saving $10,000 to move out and pay for first last and security and any additional expenses like pots &amp; pans would come out from that fund. (Ideally I'd make big purchases like couch's TVs and the such further down the line)

I don't really come from much and don't have a great grasp on financial spendings and am worried that that starting amount wouldn't be enough to stand on my own two feet and not be forced to move back in with family.

And if anyone can recommend what pet insurance they prefer.

Thank you!",1
"Just returned from getting a Covid test at Tufts Medical. It took 4 hours, and the line wrapped all the way to the other side of the block.

Wear your mid-January gear, and opt for boots instead of sneakers  (your shoes will drop to the same temp as the sidewalk about an hour into it otherwise)

"Hi Bostonians,

My name is Adam Parsons and I am a senior at Bentley University. I am a candidate in a sorority contest that essentially serves as Mr. Bentley. Typically this is an in-person event with a live audience responsible for the voting; however, this year due to COVID it was held virtually with Venmo's serving as votes. 

I play on the football team and we all came to together to bring me back from being down almost 1,000 votes today to one of the fraternity's contestants. A dollar serves as a vote and all of the proceeds are going to the Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation.

To get to the point, we have been neck and neck going for the past 24 hours. At the end of the past voting flash sale his fraternity put 2000 votes in using fraternity funds. Our team can't compete with this anymore because we are paying out of our own pockets and can't use our team funds as freely as they can. I know money needs to go countless other places right now, but if you have any desire to follow us try to overcome this huge deficit you can **donate at** u/phisigbentley **on Venmo with ""Adam Parsons"" as the description**. **You can also just watch and see the vote totals here:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPDTYlzvlKZ52ku76rGsZnha5aQwlvk-Aog32Q-\_x1Q/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPDTYlzvlKZ52ku76rGsZnha5aQwlvk-Aog32Q-_x1Q/edit#gid=0)

Can i tend to this grass? What are the rules around that?

I understand Boston's situation is pretty different, and was thinking offering snow-shoveling services could be a good way to earn money during the winter. 

However, I don't really know how great the demand would be, or how people in Boston deal with the snow. Do most people in the metro area just shovel their own walks? Do you think many potential customers exist for this kind of service?  And aside from a shovel and some winter gear, what would be other good supplies?

"EDIT: Cat was removed from the tree around 4:45pm today, thanks to James who climbed the tree and got him down. Cat ran off after it was brought down, so he's still out and about, but hopefully he learned his lesson and stays away from trees!

Hi all - I'm in Quincy and my friend who lives down the street has a cat that's been stuck in a tree for over two days. She first saw it on Saturday, but it then climbed higher into the tree and is too high/afraid to come down. From the looks of it, it doesn't look like a stray.

Here's a potato-quality photo: [https://imgur.com/a/qoa9Zau](https://imgur.com/a/qoa9Zau) (probably about 10-15ft of tree below the bottom photo edge)

Quincy Animal Control has not been helpful at all - they don't even answer their phone. Quincy FD came with a truck yesterday, but my friend's townhouse is part of a long row of buildings and the truck couldn't get close to the tree to use the ladder. And the tree is too unstable for the FD to climb or use a smaller ladder on. The tree is also located on the edge of the hill behind her complex and below the small hill are other houses, with no truck access.

The FD put a little bowl of food as far up as they could go (about 1/3 of the tree to the cat's position) but it certainly blew away last night.

We're not sure what to do, and the poor thing has withstood the torrential rain from last night and the wind/cold up that high. We're looking for any advice or suggestions on how to get it down.",1

While probably not as good as a mechanical humidifier, it seems like they require a lot less fuss so I'd like to try them.

However, I'm having a hard time to find them (evidently they're more popular in Europe than here). Most of the online options are plastic rather than ceramic, and they don't have great reviews. I haven't found a store that sells them either. I was wondering if anyone had purchased them before, and where they recommend buying them from.

I should mention that the radiators in my apartment are rounded on top, so unfortunately putting a cast iron steam on top won't work. I have put a pan of water below, but I know they should be in combination with other types of radiator humidifiers to work well.

Edit: I do want to mention I know about the Snow Joe ones, but that is plastic. I've heard ceramics work a lot better, so I was wondering if anyone know of a place that sold them.",1

"Long story short I tested positive on Friday with very mild symptoms. My boss and a co-worker had a negative antigen test, but contact tracing said that since symptoms can show up 6 to 14 days after last known contact with a positive case, they have to quarantine for 14 days.  my boss however, stated that they will both be back in the office on Monday regardless. There are also people strutting around the office with no masks on despite management essentially pleading with everyone to be 100% compliant.

I know the state has set up a portal where you can report workplace violations, but they require contact information in order to reach out to you personally, which makes me think it's not anonymous. I know there is a state regulation in place to prevent retaliation against this kind of thing, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

"Hello, 

I'm living in East Boston for 1 year. Due to irresponsible and disrespectful tenants, I will move out of my current apartment. I liked East Boston, groceries are close to my home, there are a lot of restaurants, waterfront parks, and so on. However, I found one room for rent in the North End and it made me think. It is 3 min away from Haymarket station and as I see from google maps area is crowded with restaurants and grocery shops. 

I did not do anything much in East Boston but I know the area well and I'm ok to live here, do you think moving to the North End will bring new experiences, and enjoyment to my life? 

If you choose north end over east Boston, what will be your reason?  

I think moving to a different part of the city will bring new connections to me. Do you agree with that? 

Thank you very much.

"[Here is the update](https://www.mass.gov/governor-updates), in case anyone wants to watch it themselves. Secretary of Education James Peyser and Department of Education &amp; Secondary Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley are also present.

(Actual address begins at 7:00 with James F. O'Shea, Carlisle Superintendent giving opening remarks, thanks faculty, administration, superintendents, etc. for collaborating and working hard to make in-person learning possible. Thanks DESE and Baker for leadership and support. Jokes about additional funds after his speech.)

**Baker begins speaking at 9:40:** 

* appreciates the willingness of Carlisle staff to open their doors to Baker's administration so they can see what in-person learning looks like
* notes that while the state has created advisories, says that ""at the end of the day, it's up to places like this to fit the guidelines into how business gets done in this particular school and school district.""
* talks about furniture placement, distance in the cafeteria vs. classroom, and scheduling shifts for lunch- some kids eat in class, some in the cafeteria depending on how shifts work
* the classrooms themselves, ""it's obvious you're using every square inch of space that's available in those classrooms""
* ""every kid, every child we saw was wearing a mask and didn't seem all that stressed about it, which makes them a lot more mature than many of the adults I know.""
* reminisces about... algebra in 8th grade, ended his tangent by saying how this reminds him of how important it is to get kids back in the classroom together 
* ""we've tried very hard as a state to provide people with guidances and resources, but we recognize that the 'how' is ultimately going to get made at the local level where they know their districts best.""
* ""to make change, you need people who are willing to try.""

**Commissioner Riley begins speaking at 15:01**:

* this visit reminds him of how important it is to see kids in school, congratulates the faculty and town for making this happen in Carlisle

**Baker resumes at 15:26, opens up to questions:**

* *Question 1- interrupts journalist to ask for an ""on-topic question first""*
* *Question 2- How can we make decisions like this work in other areas? \*inaudible\** 
   * Superintendent round-tables are part of the answer- having schools that are doing this and getting it done creates a template and a set of thoughts and ideas that makes it possible for other people to learn from it.
* *Question 3- \*inaudible question, something about parties, Wellesley, and Marlborough\**
   * The data is pretty clear that kids and schools are not where the vast majority of community transmission takes place, the best example of this is with parochial schools - almost 30,000 kids and 4,000 staff in person since August with less than 40 cases, and none of those cases originated inside the school. With almost half a million kids, staff, and faculty in some form of hybrid or in-learning, very small numbers with regard to infection and none of which originated in schools. Baker thinks the big message is that the public health and pediatric community have made very clear that if you follow the guidance, your opportunity to do the right thing on behalf of kids is to get them back in the classroom.
* *Question 4- We're closing in on \*inaudible\* numbers- yesterday we saw almost 2500 cases, it seems that we're reaching uncharted territory?*
   * We're nowhere near the uncharted territory we were in in the spring. Nowhere near it. Nowhere. Definitely dealing with a surge we talked about in the summer/fall, currently the largest per capita tester in the state. 80k-100k tests per day, ability to identify cases dramatically better than in the spring. Healthcare system better equipped to handle this than we were in the spring. Talking to them almost daily, and we'll have more to say about this tomorrow when we talk about the field hospitals we're planning on reopening. 
   * ""I think in many ways, this is not just an issue for MA but for the entire country.""
   * Quotes Washington Post article that the vast majority of spread is dinner parties, game nights, small informal casual gatherings with a bigger circle of friends than people were spending time with. That is in many respects what makes this so insidious. For us to win this fight, people have to recognize that spending time outside of their core circle, their core family circle, without wearing masks and distancing, your risk to contract and spread is so much higher.
* *Question 5- When people see that eye-popping number which they haven't seen since summer, what do you mean we're nowhere near that?*
   * We currently have 550 people in the hospital. We had close to 5,500 people in the hospital at the peak of this back in the spring. 10x as many people, it's many different. If you look at the DPH data book posted every day, the slope of the line was linear in the spring. I've talked about the fact it's moved since Labor Day, and that's why we changed some of the rules. The big message that is critical in all of this is familiar people being familiar in familiar settings is really, not just here, but all over the place, the major element driving the spread at this point. Mentions youth hockey, and the act of physically playing hockey - all of the socialization between kids and adults. 
* *Question 6- follow up question on hockey:*
   * Thinks all states in the Northeast agree it's the interstate games and what happens off the ice that drives transmission. Wants to set rules and guidelines to lower transmission. Admits he wants everyone playing across the region with the same, regularly enforced guides but it's going to take a few weeks to figure out how to do that.
* *Question 7- Carlisle is a smaller, more affluent community where people can afford buying more desks, etc. that's not possible in a  lot of districts, so what do you say to those schools?*
   * We recognize a significant investment needed to be made across the Commonwealth, so that's why $1 billion was invested in MA over the course of the summer specifically to pay for and reimburse schools. 
   * Many of the special needs programs, oftentimes more complicated to operate, have been in person and stayed in person through the summer and fall. That is close quarters, and there too there's been really ""modest spread"" and transmission.
   * The data is clear, the real issue is can people learn from those who have been successful and incorporate that into their own learning?
* *Question 8- socialization outside of school*
   * Superintendent takes over, notes that it's a challenge to monitor students outside of school. Administration works closely with the community, meeting 1x/week to coordinate in-school and community public health issues. Community-oriented approach to resolve conflicts.

I  am seeing that currently road test in Massachusetts is being driven in  state vehicles (or the driving school vehicles). I am wondering if the  car you arrive in is still being looked at? What I mean is: prior to  corona the car you would arrive in would be the one you would take the  road test in. And that car needed to fulfill certain requirements  (central/accessible hand brake, etc). I am wondering currently when you  arrive to the test does your car have checks from instructor and then  you drive in state vehicle, or they dont look at the car and you just go  into the state vehicle?

The  reason why I ask is that my car doesnt have central hand brake and thus  would be unsuitable for the road test. So I would be failed pre-corona  if I came with it. But if they are not looking at the car, I can just  use it and not go arround asking people to lend me car (which during  corona is not looked upon kindly). I have a road test coming up in  Plymouth.  


TLDR; Does the car you come in get checked up as before corona, or are you just given state vehicle?",1

"Serious replies only - I need help figuring this out. I plan on getting a mini Goldendoodle next year in spring or summer. Today I asked the real estate agent that listed the property for rent from the landlord if I could get an animal because my lease mentions no pets are allowed unless landlord gives written consent for one. I enquired the real estate agent regarding the process and she flat out said that the landlord has no dog policy except for support dogs. 

I replied to her saying that that was a bummer but there was a dog in the building that didn't seem like a support dog (I got confused between support dog and service dog because service dogs tend to wear vests saying they are service dogs and this dog doesn't) and said that there was one in the building. The real estate agent got back to me saying not to get my hopes up and that the landlord is probably not going to allow a dog. And then I replied telling her that I looked up if depression and anxiety were listed as ""Disability"" under the American Disability act and I wasn't aware of this because I am not from this country. I asked her if there was a note I could get from my psychiatrist mentioning that I have depression and anxiety in order to be able to get an ESA. The real estate agent immediately got back to me saying that I couldn't just create or makeup conditions just to get an ESA. I ended up sending her screenshots of my depression, anxiety and insomnia medicines and she didn't reply to those. 

Now I can get a note from my psychiatrist for an ESA, but can my landlord still reject it? I initially **did not** state that this dog would be for emotional support but I had no idea you could even get one for emotional support and when I looked it up, it mentioned ESAs can be for people who suffer from depression, anxiety, etc. Is the landlord going to reject on the grounds that I switched from it being just a dog to an ESA once the agent mentioned only ESAs were allowed? Can I still sue the landlord if he denies me an ESA? 

I suffer from depression, anxiety, and grief from trauma and could use an ESA and had no idea you could get one for those until now. And I also mixed up service dogs and support dogs due to which I didn't mention the ESA initially either. Do I have any hopes of getting a dog?",1

If there was a separate sub for that kind of stuff, I feel like the people that ask questions would be less likely to get shitty snarky answers, because only the people that wanted to be helpful that are local would subscribe?

Would it clear out the commonly asked questions, and lack of looking at the sidebar by almost everyone that comes here, if those posts were just deleted? 

I know covid absolutely changes the game for visitors and locals alike, and the way we answer questions. But if there were a sub specifically for this, would you guys subscribe to help (or not), and be happy to get the same old boring fucking questions out of our sub? Or does it seem useless and not totally worth it?",1

I plan on wearing a mask, and my brother knows I had it too, so I‚Äôm not keeping secrets.

My question mainly is: who am I showing this test to? Do they stop me when I get off the plane?? Any advice would be great!",1

**Charlie's monologue**

- Since labor day, cases have tripled, and hospitalizations have doubled
- The trends are going in the wrong direction, and [the trends] show no signs of changing.
- Creating enough space to treat COVID patients and other patients is the most important factor in planning for a surge.
- We hope to not need to use these resources, but preparing now will allow us to keep schools, the economy, and hospitals open.
- In the spring, we had no choice but to cancel or delay elective and routine medical procedures.
    - We hope to not have to repeat this.
- We are making 400 beds available by converting acute care beds to ICU beds
- We are setting up the field hospitals again, like what was done in April.
- Controlling this virus depends on the everyday actions of everybody.
    - We are seeing a spike in positive cases, mostly because people are letting their guard down.
    - Make sure to wear a mask, wash your hands, and socially distance
    - We introduced new gathering limits, and a 10 PM - 5 AM curfew to reduce the spread.
    - We don't want to go back to the restrictions from last spring, and we need everyone's help to make sure that it doesn't happen.
- Its encouraging to see the Biden white house plans to focus on COVID starting on day 1.
    - We hope that the federal action will be less politicized and more effective.
- We are encouraged by the new vaccine data from Pfizer
    - When the time comes, Massachusetts will be ready to distribute a vaccine.
    - Its important to remember that we will be living with the virus for at least the next few months
- I'm dismayed to hear the baseless claims about the electoral fraud from the president and other Republicans in Washington
    - Stalling the transition at this moment in the crisis is wildly irresponsible
    - [Charlie sounded pissed during this part of the monologue]

**Secretary Sudder's monologue**

- ICUs are currently at 50% occupancy
- Overall hospital occupancy has remained at 65-70% throughout October
- Hospitals are open and are continuing to serve all patients with medical needs
    - Statewide, hospitals are treating 7,000 patients
- We have conducted inspections of 8,700+ businesses to ensure COVID safety compliance since August 11.
    - 97% are in compliance with all rules and guidances
    - 2% were issued verbal warnings
    - 98 were charged with operating in violation of the executive orders

**CEO of Lowell General Hospital Jodie White's monologue**

- [Mr. White is also the chair of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital System Board of Trustees]
- We don't know precisely what the second wave of COVID will look like, but we are in a much better position to respond than we were in March and April.
- Our hospitals were never overwhelmed during the first COVID wave because we were able to prepare, and people socially distanced
- Get a flu shot to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the healthcare system
- Do not delay care. We are well-equipped to meet your medical needs.

**CEO of Boston Medical Center Kate Walsh's monologue**

- We are confident that we will not see the numbers of the first surge
    - [[This isn't necessarily true. Already, US hospitalizations are at a record high.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/10/world/covid-19-coronavirus-live-updates?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#us-hospitalizations-reach-a-record-high-as-medical-facilities-are-under-strain)]
- We have a year's supply of PPE available.
- We are confident that we will be able to care for COVID patients and all other patients over the next few weeks.

**Questions for Charlie**

Reporter: Without a peaceful transfer of power, what does that mean for vaccine distribution?

Charlie: Vaccine distribution is a process that is already well underway. At this point in time, its important for individuals in key roles in the federal government to be working and talking to people on Biden's transition team. Its critical that there is a focus on COVID at the federal level as we enter the coming weeks and months. Currently there isn't guidance, or a persistent message coming from Washington on the virus.

R: What can you say about the distribution of the vaccine? Which groups will you prioritize to receive the vaccine?

Secretary Sudders: At this point, its our understanding from the federal government that the states will be  establishing what the priorities are for who receives the vaccines. We've advocated Washington that the allocation of the vaccine should be done on a state per-capita basis, but so far there has been no indication from the feds about what the next steps are. [We have the current plan posted right now](https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-interim-draft-plan/download), but it is a very general plan. 

Massachusetts distributes millions of vaccines each year, so we already have good infrastructure in place to allocate the COVID vaccine(s).

R: Would elder care facilities and hospitals be at the top of the list [for who would receive the vaccine first]?

Sudders: Healthcare providers and older individuals with compromised immune systems are at the top of the list, but it really depends on how many vaccine doses we get from the federal government.

Charlie: We're still waiting to see what the actual delivery mechanism of the vaccines will be. There's a number of ways to deliver a vaccine (such as going to the nearest CVS or Walgreens) that people in long-term care facilities would not be able to safely access.

R: Have you or anyone from the Massachusetts administration been in contact with the incoming Biden administration?

C: There are a bunch of ""Boston folks"" who are in his COVID advisory group, but our governor's office has not been in contact yet.

R: The Pfizer vaccine would have to be kept at -80 C [[the actual temperature is -70 C](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-as/how-pfizer-vaccine-could-be-cold-comfort-for-some-asian-nations-idUSKBN27Q1G1)]. Are there any concerns about how that would affect distribution?

Sudders: The vaccine will come from McKesson packed in dry ice which will keep it cold for 8-10 days, and many of our hospitals have cold storage that will allow us to store the vaccine for a longer period. There are also a number of days where it doesn't have to be in cold storage before being administered.

R: What's the PPE situation in long-term care right now? [We've had a report [from August] that said that supplies are relatively low](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/08/08/massachusetts-senior-care-association-chief-worries-about-testing-ppe-as-coronavirus-creeps-back/).

Sudders: That was a troubling report, because we've been closely monitoring PPE supplies in nursing homes. Nursing homes report directly to the federal government. Of the 36 nursing homes that reported PPE shortages, 27 belonged to one company. This company believed that it needed to make a statement that they have shortages with respect to the ""conventional"" [pre-pandemic] standards, but not with respect to the ""conservational"" standards. They felt the need to make this point to the federal government by claiming that they had a shortage. 

The department of public health reached out to all 36 nursing homes from the report, and they all attested that they had sufficient levels of PPE.

R: Would you say that we are in the midst of a second surge right now?

C: Yes. This was predicted by a number of epidemiologists, and it is occurring across nearly all western countries. The enhanced amount of testing we're doing gives us much better knowledge of the movement of the virus throughout the state.

In contrast to last spring, where the rate of hospitalization increase and the rate of case increase were about equal, the current rate of hospitalization increase is about half that of the rate of case increase. This allows us to create capacity to offset the increase.

R: Are you worried that the ongoing election is ""gumming up"" the federal COVID response?

C: At this point in time, its hard for states to know what the week-to-week game plan is going to be. The current administration needs to be bringing Biden's COVID task force up to speed so we don't miss a beat.

R: How do you feel about releasing inmates with COVID? [Congressman Pressley recently urged you to do so](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/11/10/ayanna-pressley-pandemic-prisoner-release-massachusetts).

C: Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've paroled hundreds, possibly thousands, of people who would be better served in the community due to COVID. Our prison system has done a great job of keeping inmates safe from COVID. When they had an outbreak at the Norfolk prison, they moved aggressively to test everyone in the facility.

R: Has there been any discussion about moving back a phase or two?

C: There have been a number of towns that are in stage 3, step 1. We have also made changes to specific activities or communities (such as ice hockey) that are showing more COVID risk.

R: [I didn't quite hear this question, but it was about some republicans attacking other republicans who recognized Biden as the election winner]

C: I've been a republican for 40 years, and I believe in many things that the republican party stands for. One thing I don't believe in is the idea that ""elections are only legit if you win"". [Charlie was visibly angry when answering this question.]

R: Does the republican party that you support still exist?

C: Yes

R: The Celtics announced that Tommy Heinsohn has passed away. Any thoughts?

C: I'm old enough to remember Tommy as a player. He would get 20 points a night, get 15-20 rebounds, and cover the best player on the opponent's team. As an announcer, he was so profoundly committed to rooting for the home team that you would think he was watching a completely different game. That guy was all heart.

R: The GOP party leadership has had very pro-Trump  messaging. Is it time for a change of message?

C: We spend a lot of time focused on republicans in the state legislature. For 2022, we will need to recruit some candidates and focus on the issues that people care about, which are usually different than national issues.

R: Will you be on the ballot in 2022?

C: That's a long time away.",1
"Link to the state's [weekly report](https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-covid-19-public-health-report-november-5-2020/download). I highly encourage you to read this report every week.

I was curious how the COVID numbers are breaking down, now that we're in an upswing.

By far, most clustered transmission are [via household](https://i.imgur.com/VzbgaFf.png), defined as a [shared residence](https://i.imgur.com/qdo4qrI.png)

Cases [per capita by town](https://i.imgur.com/yWlcOC2.png) vary greatly. Reading the per-town data, there's a pattern that the highest cases per capita are still in towns with the lowest per-capita income.

[By age group](https://i.imgur.com/LBuayoE.png), people in their 30s have the highest cases per capita.

We are still losing an average of about 20 lives in MA per day to this disease. Before COVID, on an average day in MA, there were 160 deaths per day.

Please continue to be mindful. I understand that many of us have to continue to work and put ourselves in risky situations. Many of are forced to live with many roommates or large families.

This whole thing sucks, but the more we pay attention to the data and risk factors, the better we'll be able to mitigate the damage.",1
"I love weed just as much an anyone else, but just wanted to give a PSA because this is the third time in the last year and a half that this has happened. I know no one expects this to happen when they toss their roaches, but it can and it does so just asking those looking to enjoy a nice joint out there to be mindful of how they dispose it. That is all",1
"The people who crowded into the street yesterday were irresponsible. Those who did it without masks and/or an effort to stay distanced were very irresponsible. Of those people, the ones who are also criticizing Trump rallies and otber poor pandemic behaviors are big hypocrites.

The gatherings should have received more criticism and condemnation from people like Walsh, Baker, and even Biden. This is important for credibility, consistency of message, AND public safety. The lack of stern criticism was irresponsible and probably partisan, to a degree.

**None of this is evidence that COVID is no big deal, and none of this suggests that we should open up other activities and events.** People being dumb hypicrites about a public health hazard doesn't somehow erase the public health hazard. Large outdoor gatherings are still somewhat risky. Sustained indoor gatherings of any size are still very risky. Gatherings without masks are still very risky.

On top of all that, pushing the limits on those risks for pure pleasure adds a whole.other level of shitty-ness to the behavior. Going out in the street with a mask to demand justice for police violence or some other problem is already a risk, but at least the motives are for some kind of ""righteous"" or well-intended cause. Going out in the street just to fuck off and party is indefensible in comparison.

The fact is, a **lot** of people were selfish and irresponsible yesterday, and we **should** feel right to criticize them for it. That doesn't change the situation moving forward. Don't use one mistake as a justification for repeating that mistake. Let's at least work together a tiny bit to not get completely fucked by this virus.",1

"Hello,

I am currently under contract to buy a multifamily and have been applying to brokers, Credit unions etc. to get an investment mortgage. Own Up (A boston based online mortgage company) has come up with the lowest mortgage rate (through Mutual of Omaha) with very low closing costs. They are also giving me a discount on the attorney fee if I go with their attorney instead of choosing my own.

I was wondering if anyone has experience working with them? Positive/ negative reviews? An attorney I talked to mentioned that they are ok but it's better to get a Credit Union or one of the other mortgage brokers he recommends. Thanks!",1
"Hey all. My girlfriend and I are trying to get out of the house today due to the beautiful weather and wanted to explore the North Shore a bit.

"Great Conversation and Food! $800/mth

I am looking for a female boarder-roommate for a furnished room in a two-bedroom, 600 sq ft apartment in south Waltham, near Moody St.. Earliest availability  December 1. I am a 59 year old female writer, good cook and morning person. Since it‚Äôs as easy to cook for two as for one, I‚Äôm offering to supply food as well as all utilities (heat, electricity, Internet.) There is laundry on the premises and a yard! No off-street parking, but it‚Äôs a quiet side street and it‚Äôs not usually hard to find parking. Very close to the riverwalk. I‚Äôm looking for someone one quiet and responsible, who is not here all the time. We can discuss Covid precautions in person/over the phone. Unfortunately, the apartment is not handicapped accessible; one full staircase. Small pets negotiable. There is no storage outside of the bedroom closet.

Food, etc.: I expect that I will be able to provide about 70% of your meals. You would be welcome to half of all the food in the house and expected to do your own dishes, and generally be neat and clean. Taking the trash out occasionally would be great as would be taking a turn cleaning the bathroom &amp; kitchen floor. This is an environmentally conscious household. I ask that you recycle and conserve energy. You‚Äôre welcome to take a ‚Äòbrown bag‚Äô lunch to work/school. I cook almost everything from scratch, avoid foods with coloring or preservatives and use seasonal vegetables. My meals tend to be light on meat (all kinds as well as chicken and fish), dairy and grains and heavy on vegetables. I cook two or three main courses a week, and often something else, like yogurt (I make it myself) or a salad. I keep healthy snacks on hand, usually fresh/dried fruit and canned fish/cheese to eat with crackers. I don‚Äôt keep sweets on hand. If you want you‚Äôre welcome to occasionally cook for yourself, prepare yourself a snack and bring in whatever additional food you want.  I don‚Äôt serve meals at a particular time, rather you can take what you want from the fridge and heat it up yourself. We‚Äôll probably occasionally sit down to a meal together but it‚Äôs not scheduled. Very light alcohol &amp; marijuana use ok. All of this is subject to minor adjustments. 

Here is a list of what I‚Äôve cooked recently: chicken marbella, lentil burgers, curried squash soup with coconut milk, sauted broccoli rab, roasted root vegetables, beef stew, bean stew with yucca, chayote &amp; pork, buckwheat pancakes with molasses and sesame oil, orange juice cucumber oregano smoothie, white bean soup with kale and linguica, lentil stew with lamb bits, carrot ginger soup, stir fried rice &amp; vegetables. 

Please respond with a little bit about yourself and your plans for the future. All races &amp; ethnicities welcome, gay friendly. I‚Äôll probably do a phone screen and may want to meet you more than once before making a decision. In addition to first month‚Äôs rent, I‚Äôll need one month‚Äôs rent as security deposit/last month‚Äôs rent.",1

"Hey there, as the title is pretty self explanatory I don't have to give too much info here but will give my endgame goals:


- Free Broadcast Channels (Boston 4, 5, 7, 25, the more the merrier)
- 3 TVs (4th added sometime in the next year im sure)
- DVR service (not a requirement right away but if it's the easiest solution I'm open, would want at some point in future)

Our setup:
- Basement Tv in mancave, TV 1st floor living room, TV upstairs master bedroom
- Amazon Fire stick on 2, Nvidia Shield on 1
- Gigabit internet
- Streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, contemplating SlingTV

What we primarily watched before cutting the cord:
- Me: Pro sports (not much college), and streaming, etc (I personally can also use kodi for my needs)
- Wife: HGTV, Lifetime, E, Food Network, Programs on local Broadcast stations (ABC, NBC, FOX, etc)
- Son: he's only 2.5 yrs old. Disney+ works for him

We just cut the cord officially yesterday. We live in Weymouth, MA so the broadcast towers are in 3 or 4 main directions from our house. Unfortunately our house has no clear line of site outside as we have a farmers porch in the front and trees in the back.

I'm willing to attach an antenna to the roof if necessary (there's already a directv dish I'll reuse the spot and cabling)

I understand there are several options right now. I could get an airtv to connect the antenna to the airtv which them sends the signals to any tv that has a smart device (they all do), but if doing that I can just use locast.

Do any of you in this area use an indoor antenna and have good results on the south shore? Is an outdoor roof antenna overkill for my location?

I don't want to go overkill if I don't have to with a roof antenna, but if it's easy enough to do so with the dish being on the roof, I don't mind spending $150 for an amplified antenna and a splitter.

For DVR, is the recast or AirTV any good or do you recommend something else?

Thanks in advance!!!",1

"Voters across Massachusetts went out to the polls in droves on Election Day, although turnout in Boston appeared Wednesday to not have eclipsed that of the two previous presidential elections as some speculated it could, city officials said.

Approximately 63.5 percent of registered city voters cast a ballot ‚Äî slightly less than the 66.75 percent of voters who did so four years ago, and the 65.87 percent recorded in 2012, according to Mayor Marty Walsh.

‚ÄúBoston yesterday beat the 2008 turnout,‚Äù Walsh told reporters. ‚ÄúSo it wasn‚Äôt one of the highest. I guess if you average the last four presidential elections, we‚Äôre right in the average place.‚Äù

As a whole, Bay State voters surpassed the 3.3 million ballots cast in 2016, Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin said. He anticipated the final number to come in over 3.6 million as expected.

Walsh said city officials were still counting domestic mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday and will continue to do so through Friday. Overseas ballots can be counted through Nov. 13.

‚ÄúThese numbers that we have in Boston are not final,‚Äù Walsh said. ‚ÄúThe work is still going on and every vote must be counted.‚Äù

Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden carried the vast majority of votes in Boston against Republican President Donald Trump, or about 82.5 percent to Trump‚Äôs 15.6 percent, unofficial results show. Democratic Senator Ed Markey saw a similar landslide with 82.7 percent of the city‚Äôs vote against Republican challenger Kevin O‚ÄôConnor.

Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, of the 7th Congressional District, beat out Independent Roy Owens in Boston with just over 87 percent of the vote, while Congressman Stephen Lynch, of the 8th District, garnered 84.1 percent of ballots to be reelected over Jonathan Lott, of the Healthcare Environment Stability Party.

Boston voters also fell in line with the majority of voters across the state on Question 1 to approve expanding Massachusetts‚Äô right-to-repair law. However, while most Bay State voters shot down the proposal for ranked choice voting in Question 2, voters in the Hub apparently wanted to see the effort carried out, with 61.7 percent casting their ballots in favor of the system. [Haney vs Gamboa Live StreamS-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haneyvsgamboaliveHD/)

Voters in the city also handedly backed two non-binding ballot questions.

Question 3 asked whether lawmakers should ‚Äúvote in favor of legislation that would require Massachusetts to achieve 100 percent renewable energy use within the next two decades, starting immediately and making significant progress within the first five years while protecting impacted workers and business.‚Äù Question 4 asked whether representatives should vote to change state House of Representative rules to make all House legislative committee votes publicly available online.",1

"Hi everyone!

A couple months ago my girlfriend, her friend and I planned to drive from NY to Boston for a weekend (this upcoming weekend). Since last week, I have been monitoring the situation with COVID-19 as it has been steadily increasing in Boston, and now there are new stay-at-home orders that go in effect on Friday. This is on top of the election so stores/businesses/restaurants are boarding up heavily in case of protests/riots.

For those that live in Boston, specifically the downtown area or Back Bay, what is it like? Would there be anything to do, such as historic sites (some of which are closed temporarily from what I've researched), walk the parks, etc? With the election &amp; COVID, I can't think of things I would be doing in Boston that I couldn't just do here in NY.

Also, based on what I read on the NY gov site, it seems we would need to fill out the travel form before returning to NY and we would have to take a COVID test in Boston before returning. Then we would have to quarantine for 3 days and take another test in NY. Does anyone know if my understanding of this is correct?

*For travelers who were in another state for¬†more than 24 hours:*

*- Travelers must obtain a test within three days of departure from that state.*  
*- The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.*  
*- On day 4 of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain another COVID test. If both tests comes back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.*

I am wishing we went a few weeks ago as it doesn't seem like the best idea to go now, but I would like advice from those who have done the trip/live in Boston, as it would be my first time there.

Thank you in advance!",1

1. Standing in line before the cutoff, but then voting ends? Do not leave! You are still able to vote! If anyone says otherwise, call the nonpartisan Election Protection Coalition at (866) 687 8683.
2. If the voting machines are down, request a paper ballot.
3. Think you made a mistake on your ballot? Ask officials for a new one.
4. Requested an absentee ballot, but didn‚Äôt use it? That‚Äôs fine, you can just vote in-person (except in Kentucky, but I doubt that will be a problem).
5. If the election official says you‚Äôre not on the roll of registered voters, don‚Äôt panic: ask for a provisional ballot. Your vote will be counted after Tuesday, when they confirm your registration status.
6. If your eligibility is challenged, ask to submit a sworn statement.

Happy voting! üéâ",1

" **FY2021 Public Disclosure period:** The public disclosure period for assessed values runs from Wednesday, November 4, 2020 to Tuesday, November 10, 2020.

The value is available online [https://www.boston.gov/departments/assessing](https://www.boston.gov/departments/assessing).  You have a short six day window to appeal the assessment, which you may want to do, particularly if the details the assessors office has are inaccurate.

"Hello, I'm currently losing my mind with the state's unemployment system (and I'm not even the one making the calls!)

My friend has been told that she owes $10k in overpayment, but is flabbergasted and confused why, all of a sudden, she has been told this after having reduced hours and receiving money through the UI system since May.

She filed an appeal, and through the USPS knows that the files were received two weeks ago, but she cannot for the life of her connect to a live UI person. The live hotline, which is supposed to connect to the UI customer service, literally hangs up the phone on you when it connects. She also has no way to track the status of this appeal through their online system. 

It's completely frustrating and she wants more information or piece of mind to know that this is being taken care of. Has anyone had any similar experience? Is her main route to just assume it's being processed and to hang tight until they contact her?

(being told you owe $10k obviously causes a lot of anxiety and shock, and it's now been 3+ weeks of hitting this road block with UI)",1

I  am located on the South Shore of MA (south of Boston) and wondered if  people had suggestions as to their favorite greenhouse or garden center?

My local place has all the standard veg  starts, but I am looking for more variety and want to crowd source your  favorite places!  When living in greater Boston I used to go to  Allandale Farm in Brookline, which had an amazing selection and variety  of veg starts in the spring.  Sadly, that's just too far for me to drive  (and hauling two kids over there and the parking situation...) to get  my starts.

As  well, looking to find a nice greenhouse that I can go to in the winter  and be surrounded by beautiful plants, and probably end up buying a few  new houseplants.

"I'm worried about you, your friends, family, everyone in the germosphere.

I wonder if your mask falls down your face or slides below your nose when you talk because it doesn't fit correctly. Do you have a non-standard face/head size? Me too. That makes wearing a standard mask a bit tough.

Maybe you get grossed out by all the surgical masks in the street and gutters and are nearly sickened by the sight of a disposable mask. I understand they serve a purpose, but ew, me too. 

I would be willing to make you a cloth mask or two. Something that can stay on your face when you talk. Maybe something that even looks a little cool.  

This isn't the business I'm in or anything, more of a calling. Also, I'm not at all an expert seamstress, but I've been making my own masks since the start. 

Once again, I'm not selling these. I'm offering. I have a pretty good selection of fabrics and elastic for all different kinds of people -- from plain gray to fishes, plaids, grateful dead, rainbows, flowers, and more. They are quilting cotton on the outside, and muslin cotton on the face side, washable, with a nose wire, and I've rigged an adjustable ear strap with beads. 

I'll never ever love wearing a mask, but I do hate it a little less when it fits my face and looks appealing.

Is anyone living in a building and super happy with how quiet it is? Perhaps this is picky, but I‚Äôm not a big fan of being able to hear the neighbors stereo or the footsteps or phone calls of the people above me, especially with working from home. Would love some suggestions on good buildings.

"I'm writing this to hopefully encourage others to visit a STS testing site, even if you don't show any symptoms.

The Marlborough STS site is at the New England Sports center and open 8 am - noon, Monday- Friday. 

When I drove there the signage was a bit unclear -- someone just printed a paper that said ""COVID TESTING"" of something like that with no arrow or directions, but I noticed the parking lot full of cars so I figured that's where it was. Upon arrival someone walks up to you, hands you a form and a pen if you don't have one (bring a pen if you can, it looks like they had a limited number), and then tells you to drive up behind another car. 

I then sat there for 10 minutes until someone came up to me and snapped a photo of my form and ID, and then another 10 minutes until someone handed me a self-admistered testing kit (which also included a pack of 5 KN95 masks). You don't have to ""tickle the brain""; they just instruct you to push the swab into your nostrils and spin it around a few times, and be careful not to touch the soft part of the swab with your fingers to avoid contaminating it. 

After I finished I had to wait another 10 minutes for someone to collect it and then navigate through the maze of parked cars to get out of there. There wasn't really any clear system for the flow of people. 

I got my results 18 hours later. I didn't have to show any insurance information or pay anything.

Overall, it was an easy testing experience if a bit disorganized. It took a bit over half an hour in total. Be sure to bring an ID, a mask (and wear it when you see someone approaching your car) and bring a pen. 

The Marlborough site has been extended through January. I have to take some essential travel in December, so I plan on using the STS site to get tested prior to and post travel to make sure I don't take any chances spreading COVID.",1

"Hello world! I am a grad student in Boston trying to create a mock-up community art project focused on building empathy about COVID-19 experiences. I am planning on creating a website that shares images and stories of people who have experienced a large life change (or witnessed one) because of COVID-19. For now these stories will only be used as a mock-up visual for my 10 person class- if there is enough interest there is a *slight* chance in may turn into something larger (in which case I will contact the poster for consent). Here's what I'm looking for : 

1. A 2+ sentence story of your experience of COVID-19. Did you contract the virus? Did someone you know get it? Do you work as an essential worker (service industry, healthcare, teacher, etc) and have story from work? Did you lose someone close to you to COVID-19? 
These do not need to be huge profound stories, just something that may put it in perspective to another. 

2. (Optional, but highly recommended) A photo to accompany the story, selfies/portraits are definitely allowed.

"I just won the bid on my first home purchase, near Boston, MA.

I have an attorney, who I picked based on my Agent's recommendation (redfin), and he had good reviews online.

I have no idea how to pick a lender. Ofcourse I will shop around for the best rates and fees, but what else should i be looking for?

I have heard some of the big banks like bofa, wells fargo, quicken loans, are terrible with their service. But once i have the papers signed, what service do i need apart from just making my monthly payments? Are smaller local banks really much better?

I am planning to go for a 30 year fixed mortgage on a jumbo loan, to lock in the low rates. And I want the lowest possible rate, but i don't care too much about a couple of hundred bucks here and there in fees.

My agent told me he always uses one particular lender who does a good job. That is at US Bank which i don't know anything about except that it is a big national bank with apparently a local presence. My attorney, told me to go with someone at Eastern Bank, which is local to the area, and he says they are great specifically for jumbo loans, and that he's worked with them a lot and they do a great job.

The person at Eastern Bank offered me a rate 0.25% lower than what US Bank offered. But my agent said to shop around for rates, and bring it back to the guy at US Bank and he will match it.

Its been hard to find good reviews on either institution, or any other institution, so i dunno how to go about finding a lender. Should I do some research online (please point me to some good resources, when i google it, i see the notorious banks like bofa and quicken as top rated), and then just pick whatever looks the best?

Or should I pick one of the two recommended lenders, in which case should i go with the agent's recommendation or the attorney's recommendation?

We are signing the purchase agreement on friday so i need to lock in a lender soon.

I really appreciate and advice!! Thanks!!",1
"My gf and I live in a building in Charlestown with 4 other units in it. Last week we received a fine in our mailbox for $25 because apparently someone had put a Whole Foods bag with recycling on the curb for pickup which apparently is improper disposal. I have no idea who in our building did it, but the fine was left in our mailbox (presumably because we are unit 1)

I have no interest in trying to figure out which of the 4 units left it out there, but I also have no interest in paying $25 because someone else disposed of trash incorrectly. The fine is just made out to our building and there is no information specifying that it was given to our unit, let alone our names which aren't tied to any part of this building except the lease agreement with our landlord

Should we just suck it up or pay the fine or can we just get away with not paying it?",1

"Hi Everyone ‚Äì I am hoping if you guys could please lay out some pointers to help me make my decision.

Story:

I am from Calgary, Canada. I have a job offer from Boston. 

Currently I am a Sr. IT Consultant for a Healthcare provider and the new job offer is for IT Manager in a Healthcare step up in Boston.

Salary ‚Äì There is a decent difference of about $27K if I compare dollar for dollar (Difference of $70K Canadian $, If I apply conversion).   
But I won't do conversion for rest of the post, since I will be spending in USD.

Salary gap is good, however, when I calculate taxes and deductibles ‚Äì 

¬∑ Taxes ‚Äì Boston has a higher tax (over 27%) from my current (approx. 22%)

¬∑ Rental - is expensive ‚Äì I pay $1000 for a 1BDR. I am assuming it would be $1800 (at least)

¬∑ Pension ‚Äì I currently pay 10% (they pay 15%). For the new job, if I pay 6%, the employer will match 4.5% (403-B)

¬∑ Vacation ‚Äì Current Vacation ‚Äì 5 weeks (6 weeks next April) vs 3 Weeks (For the new Job)

When I take all this into consideration - I don‚Äôt think I am saving more than $10-12K. I think it is little low for a big move. However, I do get promoted.

Weather ‚Äì Calgary vs Boston ‚Äì Both are cold, average snowfall has a difference of about 7-10 cms (i.e. Yearly Avg - Boston receives about 2 inches less snowfall than Calgary)  
 Both are cold and experience all 4 seasons. However, Calgary often doesn‚Äôt always get Red colour in Autumn/Fall.

It randomly applied for this job, I didn‚Äôt know Boston was that cold (sorry I don‚Äôt know much about the city.) I want to go to a hotter city. I am done with snow.

**The reason for the post:**

I am hoping if you can give me Boston advantages over other cities or Why should anyone move to Boston? YouTube videos aren‚Äôt very helpful.

I am feeling a wee bit guilty that I am comprising too much to get out - The reason I say this because I am very comfortable in my job, I do things according to the way I want, I can take vacation anytime, my team is happy, they like me and vice versa. Also, my boss is amazing, he likes me and so I. Only reason I am quitting because our salaries are under freeze since May-2018.

**TLDR**; Canadian with a job offer from Boston is confused because Salary difference isn‚Äôt huge and would want to know why Boston‚Äôs advantageousness over other cities.",1
"Boyfriend and I are planning to drive up to Boston from New Haven, CT for a 3 days during Thanksgiving week. We're debating whether to stay at a hotel with free parking in one of the outskirt towns, and then drive into the city... or is it better to stay in the city (we're thinking South End area) and pay for overnight parking? Mind you, we're on budget but I think we could stand to stay in the city if the convenience outweighs the cost. 

Also please share any other things to consider. Like, if we stayed in South End, could we possibly park outside of Boston for cheap and conveniently take bus/ train to our destination/ get around using public transport and rideshare?

"I don't understand, why would we want ranked choice voting (question 2)?..

From ballotpedia: RCV is a voting method in which voters rank candidates according to their preferences. If a candidate receives greater than 50% of all first-preference votes, the candidate is declared the winner and the tabulation ends. If no candidate receives a simple majority of first-preference votes, then the candidate receiving the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. First-preference votes cast for the eliminated candidate are eliminated, and the second-preference choices indicated on those ballots are tallied as their first-preference in the following round.

So IF there's a two way (or more) tie and a third (or more) candidate(s) that is clearly not the winner, they count all the 2nd votes off of all the ballots that chose the loser as their first choice and apply those 2nd votes to the tied candidates?

Is that the only way this would play out? Do we really need to change the way we vote because of this? Does it happen that often that we have a two(+) way tie among three(+) candidates?",1

**Charlie's monologue**

- We've seen a significant increase in the number of people below 30 testing positive
- The most vulnerable residents (i.e. older people) are making up fewer of the new cases, which is a good thing
    - We've improved nursing home measures against the virus
- We will be publishing more data on clusters and where new data is coming from out this week (on Thursday).
- Over half of new cases are spread from household transmission and social gatherings
    - Local officials report that household gatherings and parties are happening more often indoors as the weather cools.
    - People need to stop hosting big parties.
    - Organized, structured, outdoor Halloween activities are far safer than indoor get-togethers
- Youth sports need to recognize and respect the virus
    - We've discovered 110+ cases, 22+ probable cases related to ice hockey in 66 cities and towns
    - These issues with hockey are happening in other states as well
    - Most teams would not make rosters available and were generally hostile to the contact tracers
    - For this reason (among others), we have immediately shut down all hockey rinks for 2 weeks
    - Its not clear if the spread is because of hockey itself, or because of the activities around it (get-togethers, hanging out at the rinks, etc.)
    - Youth hockey needs to make some changes. We look forward to working with them to do so.
- The data is clear: most of the spread is from informal social gatherings.
- We urge people to participate in socially distanced events instead of dangerous close-contact gatherings
    - Unlike the spring, people have a lot of options to do activities that are proven to be safe.
- With thanksgiving coming up, the Mass dept. of public health (MDPH) has released guidelines for how to enjoy thanksgiving safely.
    - They recommend gathering only with immediate family
    - If you do bring guests over (which isn't recommended), only invite guests who are part of your regular social circle who you already interact with regularly

**Secretary Souter's monologue**
- November and December have a lot of holiday gatherings
    - But gathering inside with multiple generations coming and going is the worst case scenario as far as gatherings go.
- The MDPH recommends celebrating with only your immediate family or hosting a virtual celebration.
    - If you decide to invite other members of your family (which isn't recommended), then keep your gatherings small, wear masks when you aren't eating, open doors and windows to allow ventilation, try to do activities outside, and get tested.
    - Consider if the risk of COVID is worth inviting over family members.
- Yesterday, we reported 1,216 new positive cases
    - 25 -&gt; long-term care
    - 25 -&gt; higher ed. testing
    - 34 -&gt; places of worship
    - 36 -&gt; known clusters (including social clubs)
    - 538 -&gt; associated with the 19 highest-risk communities
    - 598 -&gt; We don't yet know where these cases are from. Contact tracers are getting in touch.
- We see clusters emerge from two main settings:
    - Social or private clubs, and
    - places of worship
- We will be revising the COVID dashboard next week
    - We will be giving more info out about clusters

**Questions for Charlie and Secretary Sudders**

- Reporter: Are we at the beginning of a second surge?
- Charlie: We said that we were going to see an increase of cases starting in the fall, and indeed we are. We have far more information available now about where these clusters are coming from. An important differentiation with the last surge is that the demographics of the new positive tests are flipped: it's now mostly younger people getting the virus.

- R: Its been reported that [the state cannot find the source of 50% of new cases](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/source-infections-unknown-half-mass-covid-19-cases-state-says/). Is this true?
- C: It's not that we don't know the source, its that they aren't affiliated with a particular cluster. Additionally, most younger people who catch COVID don't really get sick, which makes it much harder to contact trace.

- R: You've been talking about gatherings for months and months. But these days, we're hearing about new parties shutting down schools, etc. all the time. Does this show that people in their 30s aren't listening to you?
- C: Yes, a lot of these people are throwing parties and gathering, but they're also getting tested. They're getting the message that if you're going to an event with a lot of strangers, you should get tested afterward. But we would rather they not go to these gatherings in the first place.

- R: Is the surge gonna get worse?
- C: It depends on how we as a state choose to respond to it. For example if people decide to hold Halloween parties, that will make the surge get worse.

- R: You've expressed faith that people would follow the guidance, so you generally haven't made any mandates. Based on the behavior of people at sporting events, has your faith been shaken?
- C: We have made some rules, and if you don't follow them then the ABCC (alcoholic beverages control commission) will fine you. But my faith in people has not been shaken. I get the fact that this has been going on for a long time, and people are hungry for physical presence. But there are important things we need to do to let people work, like wearing masks, socially distancing, not having parties. Its very important to me that we respect the people who will not be able to work if we have to shut down again.

- R: You've been an advocate for kids being in school. Would you agree that towns moving into the red zone should be shutting down their schools?
- C: The town of Marblehead shut down schools for 2 weeks after a party because they didn't know who had gone to that party. However the town of Swampscott (which is a red town) recently switched from remote to hybrid because there is very little evidence that the virus spreads in schools.
- C: The parochial schools are some of the best active evidence of how to open schools in-person safely. These schools are mostly in red zones, serve 30K students, but have reported just 25 cases since mid-august. I would argue that the structure, rules, and guidance made available to schools makes it possible for kids to go to school. In my mind, its not clear that being at home is any safer (because students might be spending that time hanging out without masks).

- R: Milton found some cases at the high school. Do you think Milton is mistaken in where these cases are from? [I couldn't quite hear this question]
- C: People need to look at several weeks worth of data and make decisions based on what that data says. If you have 3+ reporting periods where your town is red, you should start thinking about remote options. But otherwise, you should consider about having school in person.

- R: In June, you laid off a lot of contact tracers. Have you hired any of these people back? If not, do you have the capacity to tackle this current surge?
- Secretary Sudders: Although we did reduce the size of the contact tracing team in June, we increased it again when schools started to reopen. We now have 661 contact tracers on the CTC (community tracing collaborative) side, and we are bringing in about 30-50 new contact tracers per week. Our goal is to have 1 contact tracer for 20 cases, and right now its in the high 20s. However, we have just under 2,000 overall contact tracers.

- R: What did you mean by ""don't share utensils"" in your thanksgiving guidelines?
- Sudders: There should be 1-2 people in the kitchen creating full plates for people and then giving those plates to each person at the dining table. Also, don't steal food off of people's plates.

- R: Do you have any guidance for college students coming home for thanksgiving?
- Sudders: We certainly don't want to see college students spending thanksgiving completely alone in their dorms. But if you are coming from a [high-risk state](https://i.imgur.com/zjToVEI.png), you will need to quarantine for 2 weeks or produce a negative test.

- R: Has there been a reluctance from some groups to cooperate with the contact tracers?
- Sudders: The MDPH has 13 epidemiologists investigating clusters in Massachusetts. When dealing with hockey-related clusters, they encountered instances of (1) coaches not sharing rosters, (2) coaches instructing parents to not cooperate with contact tracers, (3) coaches who indicated that quarantine meant that you were still allowed to play on other teams, just not your current team. We are currently developing rules to allow hockey to reopen safely.

- R: Will the new rules for hockey be mandates, or just guidelines?
- Sudders: They will be mandates. If you don't cooperate with the contact tracers, we will shut down your rink or team.

- R: Is there any indication from the MDPH how close we are to an antibody test? [an antibody test shows if you've already had the virus]
- Sudders: No. We're focused on PCR tests right now. [A PCR test shows if you currently have the virus and usually takes a day or two for the results to get back to you]. However, we are currently doing sensitivity testing with the Abbott Binax tests which are point-of-care antigen tests [An antigen test will detect if you currently have the virus but is much faster than a PCR test, as short as 15 minutes]. If you go to a free testing site in Lawrence, your sample will be tested on both a PCR test and on an antigen test to determine the sensitivity of the antigen tests. If it has the sensitivity that we hope it has, then we will be deploying these tests more widely.

- R: You talked about people needing to work. With cases surging, how long does it have to get if people don't listen to your pleas and cases continue to rise?
- C: We would be pursuing targeted interventions to shut down only activities where clusters are common. We started using this mass alert on people's phones in order to let people in red communities know that there's a lot of COVID in their area.

- R: Do you envision a situation like going back to March/April?
- C: In March and April, we had very little testing and basically no data. That's not where we are now.

- R: Are there clusters connected to work?
- C: There are some. There will be more info out in the coming weekly report.

- R: How are you thinking about voting in the upcoming election?
- C: I will be voting no on question 2 (ranked choice voting) because its too complicated. I will be voting for Kevin O'Connor (Ed Markey's opponent). I will not be voting for the president.

- R: Will the election be a turning point for this pandemic? [I didn't quite hear this question]
- C: I hope so. The turnout was high for the primary because people believe there's a lot at stake. A lot being at stake means people have heightened emotions, which are only exacerbated by some of the recent news. The people's will needs to be pursued. Post election, we're still going to have to deal with COVID and all the other issues we've been discussing, but hopefully people will be more focused on fighting the pandemic once the election is over.",1

"Hello! Odd question that I'm not quite sure this is the right place for, but I can't get it out of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was on a walk to grab some tea yesterday (The 24th), and somewhat near Northeastern University I passed this girl on the sidewalk. She was kind of hunched up and doing this odd bent over thing ( Best way I can describe it is the Uttanasana yoga pose lol ) and she looked like she was in general distress. I sort of assumed she was having a panic attack of some sort and didn't want to approach her. 

About ten minutes later I was heading back and she was gone, but I saw her a few minutes later again stumbling across the street, and when she got to the sidewalk in the middle of the road (Where the T is) she started doing the bent over thing again. She looked really unbalanced and I was worried she was gonna fall into traffic, so I called the police because I had literally no idea what else to do. I was told that there were already police on the way so I went home. 

Weird thing is she just looked like some college girl, and i've never really seen anyone act like that before. She was stumbling a lot like a super drunk person would, but the bending over was real strange. Not to mention it was the middle of the day (around four) . 

There was a lot of people around so I'm hoping maybe someone here either saw the outcome or heard something about it? I haven't been able to stop thinking about it last night!

"i'm hearing horror stories about people not receiving any aid and being unemployed (through no fault of their own) in other states, especially florida. i belong to a nation-wide support group for spa workers and massage therapy. i worked part-time, 15/hrs, week, and take care of a family (all adults). my earnings were low ($15k/yr), but we often got cash tips from customers who appreciated the personal service ($5k/yr), and i had regulars with chronic conditions that were kept out of the hospital by getting weekly massage. i developed friendships with my clients, and i miss them, and i've heard they miss me. anyway, 

after furlough in march, i am still unable to go back to work, for safety reasons. my employer (who is frugal) claimed i quit when she reopened for the hair salon in june, but no massage therapy people returned. 

i got a very polite call from the the UI office, and they explained i needed a letter from my doctor, who supplied said letter in 24 hrs, which i uploaded, and they confirmed. a week later, i just got a nice letter back saying that i was approved for ongoing UI (at $143/week) and my employer's statement that i ""quit"" was denied.

"Winter is going to suck. I'm a transplant from the south, so even almost a decade in the fall leaves get me excited (actual seasons!)....but with COVID, lots of dark, and cold, and outdoors being safe for social gatherings than indoors, it's probably good to start preparing early.

**Staying Warm:**

\-if you rent, your landlord is required to pay for your heating unless your rental agreement clearly states otherwise. Landlords who provide heat must keep your unit between 68F and78F during daytime hours and at least 64F overnight. [Details here.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/massachusetts-landlord-and-tenants-duties.aspx) 

\-If you rent but pay for heat OR are a homeowner, you can apply for fuel assistance if your household income is less than $65,008. Fuel assistance is done by towns rather than at the state level, and payments start Nov 1. [Details here](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/apply-for-home-heating-and-energy-assistance) and [some other details](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/when-am-i-protected-from-having-my-utilities-shut-off) about not getting gas/water/electricity shut off. 

\-Because again, I am a transplant from the south, I'm not going to try to make extended recommendations on winter gear. But I've stocked up on sweaters (thrifted from Goodwill in Davis mostly), socks, a pair of good quality gloves, some baselayers, boots, an insulated hat, and a quality heating pad. My partner bought a waterproof, insulated ground blanket so that we can sit outside without the cold seeping in. I've seen a lot of (apparently) quality coats for sale on deep discount on Facebook Marketplace. 

**Staying Sane &amp; Healthy:**

\-We're going to have less total sunlight per day, but sunlight continues to be pretty important for at minimum \[quality\] sleep and probably mood. I'm lucky enough to keep working, and my current process is to set an alarm to remind myself to walk at lunchtime. If I didn't, I would go to work and leave work in the dark. Easy to read [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48268110) about sun and sleep. A[bove my paygrade scientific paper about the same thing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/). [Details about how to think about this if you do long hours shift work](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/light.html).

\-If you can't regularly get outside, or are really sensitive to the cold, [maybe try a sun lamp](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-sun-lamps-best-to-improve-your-winter-mood/)? 

\-If you live or work anywhere in MA and have an email address, you can sign up online for [a Boston Public Library e-card](https://www.bpl.org/ecard/), with no in-person setup required. 99% of what I read and watch comes from this system, and it's great.

"Just a heads-up for everybody going to vote early (highly recommend doing so!) in Cambridge. The address listed for the Longfellow Community School polling place is incorrect. The Community School shows up next to the Valente Library voting location on Google Maps, but the address listed (where the voting site *actually is*) is 359 Broadway (the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow School, which doesn't show up on Google Maps), a mile away. Helpful for those of us that live near Harvard/Central/ Riverside.

"The victim, 38-year-old Carrie O'Connor, was found in the elevator on the first floor. She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

""I heard someone that was bringing in a package out in the hallway, and then I heard an ungodly scream,"" said neighbor Leanne Scorzoni. ""Then we ran out into the hallway, and we saw a gentleman who was obviously in distress. He was screaming and hyperventilating, saying: 'She's dead! She's dead!'""

The incident report included photos that showed the elevator and a large package that investigators say the victim was trying to move.

The inspector says the package hit a button, causing the elevator to move down while the door was still open.

"Today, I was in my front mudroom (North of Boston) doing some work and these 2 guys, one looked more like late teens/early 20's, came up to the door soliciting. Before the older guy knew I was there I heard him comment to the younger guy ""It's nice up here huh, separate from..."" or something to that effect, my place is set up and back from the main road a bit, never would I consider it a ""nice"" feature, more of a pain the ass to mow.

After asking the lead guy by the door to step back since he was wearing his mask below the nose I opened the door and asked him what did he say about it being nice up there or something, he lowered the mask and answered that he was just saying it was ""unique"" sounding a little sarcastic. I asked him what he wanted and he started on some ""renewable energy"" thing, so I said I wasn't interested, they left. 

I didn't see them stop at my neighbors so I really don't know if I was just the last house on that side or what, but I called police to report them. They seemed shady, were dressed in street clothes and only had some laniard on with no clear ID.

Now I'm thinking I should have grilled them a little for more information because at this point I'm assuming they were casing my place and am feeling kinda paranoid about it.

I've heard there are scams like this around energy, but don't they usually try to dress the part? These guys were not trying at all. Both had caps, one had a t-shirt, the other a buttoned down flannel.

"Yesterday was trash pickup in my neighborhood. Around 9am, I dragged my trash and recycle bins to the curb. When I got home, the barrels were not at the bottom of my driveway like they usually leave them. I found my recycle bin a couple doors down and across the street, but was unable to locate my trash bin. I walked up and down both sides of the block, peeking into side yards, but it was nowhere to be found. I even asked a few people who I saw out on the street, but they didn't notice anything. I texted my landlord about what happened and waited for their reply.

This evening, she texted me back that ""tenants are responsible for lost trash bins"" and she would be charging me $85 for a new one. She also tried to imply that maybe I left it sitting on the curb for too long and maybe that's why it's missing. I reminded her that yesterday was trash pickup and that I had texted her after trying to locate it when I got home from work. It's unreasonable to expect me to come home during the middle of the work day to monitor my trash bins, and besides, I've never had trouble before. I put them on the curb before work and I drag them back to their spot at the other end of the driveway when I get home. I only work 8 hours, totally normal.

I decided to do a little research and found some information on [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/doc/105-cmr-410-state-sanitary-code-chapter-ii-minimum-standards-of-fitness-for-human-habitation/download) regarding the Dept. of Public Health, specifically 410.600(C) which states, ""The owner of any dwelling that contains three or more dwelling units, the owner of any rooming house, and the occupant of any other dwelling place shall provide as many receptacles for the storage of garbage and rubbish as are sufficient to contain the accumulation before final collection or ultimate disposal, and shall locate them so as to be convenient to the tenant and so that no objectionable odors enter any dwelling."" This leads me to believe that my landlord needs to procure and provide the trash bin, even though it states in my lease that the tenant is responsible. I'm pretty sure things that are illegal and/or in violation of codes are not enforceable in any lease or contract.

So, r/boston, what's the verdict here? Thanks in advance...I appreciate you all.",1

"NYE 2012: One of the few years I've been popular enough to have multiple plans. I had 4 different tentative plans that night, all with queer men. In my mind I referred to them as ""the four homos of the apocalypse."" (I'm a queer woman). I think this was the first NYE after I broke up with my girlfriend. First I went to the party of a guy who I used to work with, bringing along with me a friend. Said friend was more bi than I had realized, and at the first party I went to, told me he had a crush on me. We went to a second party, all homos (I have never felt less interesting to a room full of people), where he kissed me on the cheek at midnight. I left him in a sea of muscular dudes and took a cab to Club Caf√© to meet up with homo #3 (homo #4 wisely decided to stay in). The vibe at Club Caf√© was weird and desperate. I made out with a woman I'd just met for the first time in my life, and hated it. On the dance floor, another woman started feeling me up and trying to make out with me until I pushed her off me. I stopped dancing after that. My friend said ""Have you ever made out with a gay man?"" I told him no, and I didn't want to. Finally, I left the club. My head hurt, and I had come to the realization that New Year's craziness is no fun. Out on the street, a young, short Black man was shivering and trying to hail a cab. He had no jacket, and this was Boston winter. No cabs stopped. He told me he'd come to the club with some lesbian friends who had borrowed, and gone home with, his coat, which had his wallet and phone in the pocket. I said we could take the cab together and split the fair. The cab dropped us off in Central Square, where I'd left my car. But I couldn't find it. The cab wasn't taking credit cards, and I had just enough cash (or maybe less?) to get us to the street I was pretty sure my car was on. I had to kind of beg the driver to take us around a little bit to look for a car. I remember the guy I was with wanted to write for tv. He was either working on some scripts or just dreaming about breaking into tv writing somehow.  He loved Roseanne (this was before she was evil). He was just nice, and was unfazed by my inability to find my own car as we walked around the bitterly cold streets. At one point, we stepped over a giant white feather, and I thought, that's a sign. This is good. I had never dated a cis man before, but I was beginning to think about maybe trying it. We finally found my car and I drove him home. He said ""I'd love to text you sometime,"" and I gave him my number. I went home, slept badly. The next morning, I realized I left my phone in the cab. I couldn't remember which cab company it was, but I called a few. It took a few days to replace it. If I did indeed get any text messages during that time, I never received them. So I don't know if he texted me. But every so often I remember that very weird New Year's in which more happened in one night than usually happens to me in months. I wonder what, if anything, would have happened if I hadn't lost my phone.",1

"Hi Boston,

I currently live in central Florida and will be starting at the University  of Massachusetts online in the Spring of 2021.

Our (my boyfriend and I) goal is to move to Boston for our next career move. I've applied to several jobs and even got a professional resume writer from Boston to polish me up. I recently applied to a job with a $40,000 salary with the location of the business smack dab in the city center.

My question is- what area in Boston could that salary afford to live? Should I accept a job with that salary?

1 bedroom minimum, 2 pets, close to the T and no roommates if possible. 

Any help or advice will be appreciated!",1
"I was leaving the Racepoint visitor lot last weekend before a man with binoculars yelled at me and told me he could see Boston.  I told him Boston would be more to the left (NW), but then I looked at what he pointed to and there *were* buildings visible with the naked eye. 

Luckily I had my Nikon P900 which has an 83x optical zoom to get a closer look. The buildings didn‚Äôt look like Boston to me, but the only other options I could think of were Portsmouth, NH or Portland, ME.  Portland is much further away so that presents a problem. 

Similar pictures (but less magnified) of buildings from Pilgrim tower were posted here 7-8 years ago, and lots of folks thought they were fake, so I‚Äôll say it now - these aren‚Äôt fake! :)

Does anyone recognize the buildings?",1
"Has anyone been to this gym? I moved to Boston last fall and did not join a gym before COVID hit, and I'm looking for places to potentially join once things are safer. I've read some good things about The Ring and I think it might fit what I'm looking for, but I'd appreciate any insight!

For context, I am not very fit and am looking to get more in shape. I used to go to an ILoveKickboxing before I moved, and I liked the workout but did not like their attitude toward food/dieting and the way they'd offer unsolicited advice on that topic (fine if you want it, but I did not need to be told to only eat a quarter of a mango so I didn't have too much sugar).

I'm looking for a place where I can do group classes and a boxing-type workout because I feel like I need the structure of someone leading my workout. However, I don't want the atmosphere to be too intense. As someone looking to get back into working out at a gym, some boxing clubs are really intimidating to me. It's also a plus if they have classes offered at a variety of hours. In non-COVID times I work relatively long hours and need to be able to take some classes at 6:30 or 7 pm.

Thanks in advance!",1
" From the BPS Superintendent's Email:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Dear Boston Public Schools Community:
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) released data showing the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate increased to 5.7%. This is an increase from 4.5% last week and from 4.1% two weeks before.
&gt; 
&gt; Current data are showing a concerning upward trend of COVID-19 activity in the City of Boston and, out of an abundance of caution, Mayor Walsh and I have decided to suspend in-person learning for all students. Effective tomorrow, Thursday, October 22, all BPS students will learn remotely until public health data shows a downward trend in positive COVID-19 cases.
&gt; 
&gt; We remain committed to providing in-person learning opportunities to our students as soon as it is safe to do so, and will continue to prioritize our students with the highest needs for in-person learning. Once the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate is below 5% for two consecutive weeks, we will begin to welcome our students with the highest needs back for in-person learning. When the citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate is below 4% for two consecutive weeks, we will restart the phase-in of in-person learning beginning with our youngest students.
&gt; 
&gt; Some families received communication within the last week notifying them of their child‚Äôs in-person start date. That information has now unfortunately changed due to this news. All BPS students will learn remotely effective Thursday, October 22. We will provide you with any update to our plans as soon as they develop. In addition, schools will work with families who may need to pick up technology or other personal items students may have left at school. We are also exploring options for providing services for our students with complex disabilities and will update families with more information in the coming days.
&gt; 
&gt; The City of Boston has increased testing efforts and outreach to impacted neighborhoods. More information about COVID-19, including testing sites and community resources, is available boston.gov/coronavirus. For more information about remote learning, technology resources and free meal sites, visit bostonpublicschools.org/reopening.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that these are uncertain times. I thank you again for your patience, flexibility, and collaboration as we all work to provide enriching learning experiences for our students during this challenging time. Stay safe and healthy.
&gt; 
&gt; All my best,
&gt; ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
&gt; Dr. Brenda Cassellius
&gt; Superintendent""

Very unfortunate news for families, but the uptick to 5.7% from the previous 4.5% is equally scary. Good luck to my fellow families and fellow staff members out there.",1
"Hey there! I would usually just use the sidebar, but I know most of was written in the good ole' corona-free days. 

My friend and I are visiting this weekend from Philly... we're on the paranoid/careful side of this pandemic and have barely left our houses, but are slowly (or quickly) going mad and decided to risk a road trip and hotel room. 

Any suggestions for outdoor activities? We'll probably do outdoor dining one night if there are places that feel safe, but I wondered if there were suggestions for other pandemic-cautious places. 

I did live in Beacon Hill for a few years so I know a little, but that was in 2004 and I know a lot has changed since then. 

Thanks!",1
"City went from 4% to 5.7% in one week.

At the risk of very, very few people understanding what this is, I would like to present 'THE FiERCE BRooD', an actual play role-playing experience every Wednesday (tonight!) at 8 PM on my YouTube channel. If you take the roleplaying game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and then cross it with historical, true-to-life Boston in 1918 and fictional, supernatural horrors, then you'd have the basic idea of what we're doing. Roleplaying is basically a group storytelling game in which players, led by a narrator (referred to as the Game Master), make up a story together.

**'THE FiERCE BRooD‚Äô is an otherworldly, cosmic horror roleplay adventure set in Boston in 1918, at the height of the influenza pandemic and end of the Great War. As our Player Characters discover, however,** ***there are other worlds than these..!***

With each episode of **'THE FiERCE BRooD'**, we blend actual events, notable locations, and important figures of the time with fiction. Exploring historic Boston and the surrounding areas, the *dramatis personae* confront ancient monsters of legend and make horrific discoveries that call into question humanity's place in the universe.

If a cocktail of equal parts Stephen King, David Cronenberg, and HP Lovecraft mixed with two parts accurate history sounds like your kind of drink, give us a try. **‚ÄòTHE FiERCE BRooD‚Äô** is a roleplaying experiment that educates and enlightens as much as it entertains and engages.

# Watch us live on YouTube every Wednesday (tonight!) at 8 PM EDT / 5 PM PDT and be sure to look out for a few noteworthy cameos that should interest horror fans, in general, and Cthulhu fans, specifically.",1
"I recently received a warrant to collect an excise tax from the city of Brookline where I have an apartment... Bit of backstory I purchased my vehicle last Oct in MA and the vehicle was originally registered to my MA address. However, my official domicile is my home back in Maine. As a result when I went back to Maine for extended period of time in April I re-registered it there and paid the full excise tax there ($800). 

Now the town of Brookline has sent me this notice demanding $700. I recently lost my job and cannot afford to pay the additional $700 plus it seems ridiculous that I should have to pay over $1500 in total excise taxes. The letter also threatens to block registration with the RMV. However since both my registration/license are in ME are there other negative consequences of simply not paying them?",1

"I was worried about potentially long lines and long turnaround times for test results, so I just wanted to share my experience here in case it helps anyone else looking to get tested.

I got tested at Florence Street Park in Everett on Monday morning. No registration needed, you just walk up to the tent outside. This is a Stop the Spread site, so completely free for Massachusetts residents. They don‚Äôt ask for any insurance info and you don‚Äôt need symptoms to get tested.

The test site opened at 7 am. I arrived around 7:15 and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me. They hadn‚Äôt actually started testing people yet. Once they got going it was taking 1-2 minutes per person. I was out of there a little after 7:45. When I went there was plenty of free parking available on Florence Street.

Results were promised in 24-48 hours. I got my results by email just 13 hours after my test (negative!). Overall I was really pleased with the testing site and would go there again if I had to get tested. 

Note this site is only open Mondays 7 am-noon, but the same provider operates [various testing sites](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/stop-the-spread) around Everett Monday-Saturday.",1

"When the pandemic hit...as many of you know...BSC tried to put us on some virtual plan. I responded by saying I was not interested and to cancel my account. I also blocked my credit card at the bank level. This summer they tried to restart everyone and, again, I said ""no."" But never heard anything back. Today I received an email saying my account was three months overdue (apparently the bank block worked) and was being sent to collections. Is there anything I can do?

**PLEASE HELP: We are still searching for our sweet boy, Cyrus. We have not gotten any leads since he went missing in Brockton, MA yesterday. To anyone in Massachusetts: please keep an eye out for our dog and if you see him, do NOT call out for him or try to chase him because he is scared and will try to run. He is a big dog and might have gotten very far in the last 24 hours. Please call (610) 324-5192 and animal control IMMEDIATELY. He may still have his orange leash attached to him. He is 150lbs, brindle Mastiff/lab mix.**

If you see him, PLEASE call that number or animal control. Cyrus is the sweetest, gentlest baby angel who is terrified of people and he will run if chased. 

Keep your fingers crossed for us ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"PLEASE HELP! My buddy has been missing since Saturday afternoon. His name is Cyrus, he is a 150 pound Mastiff/Lab mix, brindle coat with a white chest. He should still have an orange leash attached to him. He is very shy and will not approach other people, but if you see anything please call Brockton Animal Control. He escaped from our trainers yard in the Baltic Ave area, but has been gone so long now he might have ventured into Abington/Holbrook/Rockland.

Well lads,

I'm trying to immerse myself a bit more with Irish Americans, so learning a little bit about them. Ireland is hoping on a Biden win as you can imagine as he has made some comments in support of Ireland with regards to the whole Brexit deal and how it would affect peace in Northern Ireland - basically encouraging Britain to keep to it's commitments as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement. The Irish value the link it has with America.

This may sound like a dumb question but I'll fire away anyway. Is the whole Irish thing still big in Boston? 

I've heard that South Boston would be more Irish and I've heard terms like Southies etc? Do you ever get a feeling that you're in an Irish neighborhood?

"So..... I was issued a ticket north of Boston but still in Boston. I am from out of state but was living there for a couple of months for work. I was never able to find the ticket on the website to pay for it so I just assumed the cop never entered it. I even got a cop friend to check the database and he couldn't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the problem. Last month Massachusetts sent something to the state of Alabama where I am from that I have an unpaid ticket and they suspended my license. I have been trying to contact the RMV every day for over a month. When I call theres 200+ people already on the phone before me. I have a very busy time ahead of me and I cant sit on the phone for 6 hours waiting. What can I do to fix this. I still have the physical ticket and the address that he wrote on the ticket to mail it to me is not my address. I guess thats why I never got anything in the mail about it. The state of Alabama says they cannot reinstate my license until Massachusetts reinstates me (thats stupid considering I have an Alabama license).

&amp;#x200B;

Who can I call? I cant do the reinstate payment on the website because it just gives me an error on my social and birthdate and all of that. This is very embarrassing and extremely infuriating.

&amp;#x200B;

It also doesn't give me a way to put in a call back number. I have been calling 857.368.8000

&amp;#x200B;

"I live in the North End and I am wondering how likely it would be that the landlord would be able to find a new tenant right now.

I resigned my lease back in the Spring for a September 1st lease, and I have been regretting it every single day since the end of summer. I work 70 hours a week (from home) in my studio apartment. For the last month or so there has been construction happening on the street next to me that has led to the sounds of drilling and hammering all day long. After that, there are only a few quiet hours before my neighbors, a few floors up, host large get togethers that are noisy into the early AM hours (at least 3-4 days a week).

On top of all that, trying to find parking in the North End is awful. Between the construction vehicles taking up spots over night, pop up outdoor restaurants taking up spaces, and all the non resident parked cars (who never seem to get ticketed), it takes an average of 30min-45min to find a spot. It‚Äôs fucking awful.

As I write this, my neighbors (who don‚Äôt appear to be doing anything wrong other than hosting a small but very loud get together) are back at it again. I‚Äôve already worked 12 hours today and I‚Äôm likely going to be working until sunrise. I can‚Äôt take it anymore.

"&gt;I don‚Äôt really understand why you‚Äôve waited this long to presumably ‚Äúfollow the rules‚Äù / listen to medical professionals only to throw it away at the end?

That's a good question, and deserves a respectful answer. 

In a nutshell: I do not think the amount and extent of restrictions are commensurate with the risk. I understand that a very small number of people will die or get sick if they get infected, but it's been clear for months that most people will not, especially if they are young and healthy. And while I am willing to make small sacrifices to mitigate a small risk and large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk, I am not willing to make large sacrifices to mitigate a large risk. It doesn't make sense, and I'm not going to do it. 

Now, I do understand that some people are more vulnerable to this thing than others, and I am willing to make a large sacrifice to protect them. I hate my mask, but I wear my mask to protect the vulnerable. I am going absolutely insane without my usual outlets and social activities, but I understand that sacrificing those social activities helps protect people who have a good chance of dying or experiencing severe symptoms if they get sick, so I am going to do what I can to protect them. 

But once those people have the opportunity to get vaccinated, the calculations change. And nobody has the right to force me to make large sacrifices to mitigate a small risk. 

That's how I feel, anyway. I hate all these restrictions. They've been very hard on me. I'll follow the guidelines to prevent widespread suffering, because that's part of being civilized. But once widespread suffering is off the table, so is my compliance.",0

Hmm... as for my level, I don't really have a number. There was a time when I supported the lockdown in NYC, when it first started in mid-March. The numbers were so crazy and we didn't know what the virus was capable of. I flipped when I had a good idea of what the risks are and how quickly people are dying. 270k is a lot of people, but a drop in the bucket compared the 3 million that die per year of other causes. Also keep in mind the actual number is probably lower than 270k  since hospitals are incentivized to report covid deaths. e.g., someone has both covid and AIDS and dies, there's a big incentive there to list that as a covid death.",0

"**[Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism)**

Fascism () is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, democracy, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left‚Äìright spectrum.Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants.

"&gt;I got pulled over by Border Protection *well* inside our border (about 100 miles) for a ‚Äòpapers please‚Äô check. If that‚Äôs legal then so is this.

No, the 100-mile border zone powers 1) only apply to federal law enforcement, not state/local law enforcement (except for state/local cops 'deputized' by federal officers) and 2) more importantly, [only apply to **enforcement of immigration law**](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone):

&gt;Border Patrol, nevertheless, cannot pull anyone over without ""reasonable  suspicion"" of an immigration violation or crime (reasonable suspicion is more than just a ""hunch""). Similarly, Border Patrol cannot search vehicles in the 100-mile zone without a warrant or ""probable cause"" (a  reasonable belief, based on the circumstances, that an immigration  violation or crime has likely occurred).

There is no 100-mile border exception for enforcement of non-immigration laws.",0

The bird was gorgeous, and I wish I knew what it was - I didn't want to disturb the bird watchers, and covid an all. It looked like some sort of hawk, pretty dark in color. Not too big, but not small either. It was neat to see so much interest in this little bird",0
"&gt;What kind of papers do they want to see? As citizens we're not obligated to carry proof of citizenship nor do we have green cards.

In theory, at *interior* Border Patrol checkpoints, [if you're a U.S. citizen, you have the right to refuse to show your ID](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/cbp-cant-detain-domestic-flight-passengers-refusing-suspicionless-id-checks). As you note, U.S. citizens are not required to carry proof of citizenship when traveling domestically within the country.

In practice, I strongly recommend carrying proof of citizenship, such as an Enhanced driver's license or a U.S. passport card. All too easy for a power-tripping agent to break the law and illegally arrest you for not being able to prove your citizenship on the spot; this [apparently happened **300 times over 4 years at a single bus station**](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17490904/customs-border-protection-patrol-checkpoints-100-miles-legal)!

Much better, if it comes to it, to be able to prove your citizenship on the spot if forced, and then file a complaint afterward, than get (illegally) arrested/detained for hours on end and have your day (or more) ruined. Either way the agent is unlikely to face serious discipline for breaking the law, so you might as well do yourself a favor and minimize your risk of getting illegally arrested.",0
Am I seeing a different image than you? I‚Äôm a little confused.,0
"There's another line the right wing has drawn, too, which has never made much sense to me. At the state level, they support voter ID laws almost reflexively, the stricter the better. They also support tying issuance of state driver's licenses to not only proof of identity but also proof of citizenship. At the federal level, they support mass domestic surveillance conducted by the NSA, which scoops up - among many other records - every website everyone ever visits within the U.S.

Yet, despite being *perfectly fine* with ever-more-stringent state ID requirements, and despite being *perfectly fine* with federal mass domestic surveillance, they [cry foul at the very idea of a national ID card](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/24/blocking-the-pathway-to-a-national-id/).

Seconded. I'd add the hassle - especially during a pandemic - of cleaning and disinfecting the car, gassing it up between rentals, taking it in for regular maintenance, etc. (oil changes every six months; car washes every 2-3 months; getting your tires and brakes inspected regularly and changed every few years; annual emissions inspections...).

Like if you're currently in between jobs, or a 'house spouse', or something, maybe you don't mind the effort in return for a small stream of spending money. But if you both already have full-time jobs, I really don't know that it's worth the hassle of becoming a small-time ""car landlord"".",0

Yes, we can point to a few specific instances of anti-Asian laws and actions in America like the Chinese Exclusion Act or the Japanese internment camps, but for the most part America did not have large populations of Asian-Americans until the late 19th century, whereas America and its antecedent institutions as British colonies have been predating on black and Native American peoples for centuries, and while ""Latino"" is a relatively recent cultural designation historically most Latin people in the Americas would definitely be counted as black and/or Native American and would be discriminated against as well.",0

"There really wasn't one. At least not a statistically significant one. 

Violent crimes in nyc declined only from 203k to 195k during Dinkins term. To put that in perspective, they were at 162k 5 years before Dinkins took office. By the end of Guilianis first term, they had declined to 124k.

People can't have it both ways. Giuliani was either an authoritarian who sacrificed civil rights for crime reduction or he wasn't.  He was and it worked. Nyc crime rates fell dramatically more than cohort cities from that point forward. The only real question is at what cost. That's the sensible debate.",0

"I don't believe this should explicitly be made illegal, seem to be bifurcating commerce. When online and other businesses don't accept cash, yet if you operate a storefront, its illegal for you to not accept cash. Shouldn't this be the businesses choice? Why is this regulation so narrowly focused to store-front only point of purchase businesses?

I'm also interested to hear which group(s) have standing to have been caused harm by not accepting cash? I'd guess its low-income peoples who don't have cards? You could easily argue that banning card-only business could effect these people, however they do have access to pre-paid cards and businesses that operate non-cash are highly unlikely to have customers that are cash-only. I think the ban is overstreching to protect a group that is incredibly small and not actually harmed.

Personally I don't think violence between kids is a special moral category but I'm probably in the minority there.  My reasoning would be that if the same act would be a crime if a child did it to an adult, or if an adult did it to a child, then the fact that both aggressor and victim are children shouldn't change things.

"That's the [law](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-guidelines-allowing-out-state-travelers-test-out-mandatory-14-day) right?  The 14 day quarantine is replaced by a testing requirement (before arriving back in NY and after arriving too).  Personally I try to follow all the relevant laws as much as possible, and this law seems quite reasonable.

I think it's tricky to tell people to take further steps beyond what the law requires, like staying home entirely.  I would defer to experts, who at least have thought a bit about the cost-benefit analysis.  The CDC [says](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/when-to-delay-travel.html):

The truth to schools is that the vast majority of city students are already remote.  Less than 30% opted in for in-person instruction, and even fewer turn up.  The whole experiment was doomed from the start, and should have been targeted towards the at-risk/higher need population.  They should have focused on kids who need to be in school because they don't have supervision, don't have the tech to do remote learning, have food security issues, special needs, etc.  This way, they could have covered the kids who need it most as close to 100% as possible, as opposed to trying to cover everyone between 20-40% (assuming 1-1.5 days/week in in-person instruction for blended learners).",0

But if you‚Äôre in a car with another person for 8 hours a day you‚Äôre gonna get infected with whatever they have ‚Äî mask or no mask. There‚Äôs a fatalistic aspect to their mask compliance.

I‚Äôm also curious whether the folks who work for the NYPD, FDNY, and other EMS services get tested more regularly ‚Äî I‚Äôd imagine folks working an ambulance get a rapid test every shift. That might lead to higher positive test rates as they are also tested at higher rates.",0

"&gt;grasping straws here to justify 2775 workers at $32 a hr with 192+ earning 6 figures for a glorified greeter/customer service rep during a budget crisis ....which for all purposes no other transit organization would pay that much even in HCOL cities with complex metros. These workers should have been phased out decade ago. Relics of the past.

This program was approved while Byford, someone who worked in other HCOL cities with metros, was at the helm in his attempt to make the subways a world class system.  It was a program that diversified the responsibilities of the Station Agent.  And as far as earning 6 figure salaries, if a worker was going to put in their time, it is not uncommon to make 6 figures, but be honest about the numbers, making $100,000/yr means they spent atleast 60hrs/wk at work as opposed to going home to their families.  It's not like they were getting free money, and to insinuate so is kinda insulting to people who actually put in their time for this blood money.",0

Doesn't matter. Try running it non-profit. Or anything at all.

Yes it's an essential government service. Which is why it's long been used as a way to extort city taxpayers. 

It was built a hundred years ago, and shouldn't only need upkeep and maintainance, which should cost much less than what we pay.

To not privatize it, is to simply allow the MTA to keep demanding more and more, even as users dwindle. Tokyo is the biggest city in the world and their metro has been privatized for the same reason.

The administrative overhead of that is going to be ridiculously expensive, inconsistent, easily gamed by all the people you really wish to target, and where a bunch of people you weren't trying to target get caught up in it.

You've got all sorts of different ways in which the it's difficult to determine how much someone is ""worth"".

- Mommy and daddy have millions and I live off their money? No income, no wealth, I'm poor.

- Farmer who's barely making a dime but the land is worth money (in theory, although buyers for random chunks of Upstate NY may or may not exist)? I'm wealthy even though my bank account's empty!

- Most business owners and really wealthy people shove most or all of their wealth/assets behind LLCs and other entities not exactly ""theirs"" legally. The taxes may get paid, but trying to determine ownership or how much ""wealth"" that means the owner has at any given time, is complicated and difficult.

This will all get even harder with out of state drivers where the state doesn't even have their tax records, as well.

"**[2007 Brooklyn tornado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007 Brooklyn tornado)**

The 2007 Brooklyn tornado was the strongest tornado on record to strike in New York City. It formed in the early morning hours of August 8, 2007, skipping along an approximately 9 miles (14 km)-long path, from Staten Island across The Narrows to Brooklyn. The worst damage was in and around Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn. The U.S.

"Our company (ad agency specializing in digital marketing) has been just as profitable since we started WFH. We‚Äôve even had some pretty big client wins since then.

I *really* hope this leads to a new schedule such as staggered work weeks or atleast having mondays or fridays off.

These settings (besides households) are structural because.. capitalism- governors will not challenge that, they‚Äôll instead blame it on other ‚Äúsuppressable‚Äù businesses.

"No idea how it ""worked"".  It [seemed to work](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/cuomo-expected-to-reveal-shifted-cluster-zone-maps-some-spots-could-see-restrictions-eased/2679635/) about 3-4 weeks ago.  

&gt;Combined, the initial red zone areas in Brooklyn, Queens and Rockland  and Orange counties now average a 4.5 percent positivity rate, compared  with a 7.9 percent positivity rate the last week of September. That  soaring rate at the end of September is what prompted the renewed  restrictions, which were initially put in place for two weeks. That  window expires Thursday.   
&gt;  
&gt;Brooklyn's orange zone areas will move yellow, which allows schools to  reopen with mandatory weekly testing, while its yellow zone areas will  remain yellow. In Queens, the north red zone and the orange zone both  turn yellow, while the north yellow zone remains as is for now. Cuomo  said he also adjusted the cluster zone map to capture a recent uptick in  the Ozone Park neighborhood.   
&gt;  
&gt;In the Far Rockaway cluster, the red and orange zones also turn yellow  while the yellow zone remains in its current precautionary  categorization. The situation hasn't sufficiently improved in Rockland  County, despite some progress, Cuomo said. Those maps don't change.  Orange and Broome counties' maps don't change either.",0

"The reason why Cuomo is saying that is because Trump‚Äôs FDA stopped enforcing compliance and monitoring measures for clinical trials. Most famously/recently the FDA recommended hydroxychloroquine under immense pressure from the Trump admin. While its efficacy to treat Covid has always been dubious, it was recently confirmed by a study that it offers no  benefit to treating Covid pts. Cuomo is saying that the FDA is compromised politically and whatever vaccine that comes under FDA recommendation necessitates extra scrutiny. Cuomo sucks, but I have to agree with him here. Can‚Äôt afford more mistakes.",0

The economy has changed a lot in the past decade, with software taking an enormous share of the city's engineering resources. Advanced manufacturing is less labor intensive than large-scale fabrication, which characterizes a lot of the last decade of manufacturing job growth across the shale patch.

"Ok what you need to do is obviously have the tax returns. Luckily landlords are desperate right now so you can use that to your advantage. The landlord is going to wonder why your income jumped so you will need to explain this. The landlord will wonder how steady your cashflow is. If you have a boost this year but it is not steady into next year then I would not expect to get the apartment. But if you can show business income for the previous 2-3 months and show that it is steady and explain why it went up then you should be fine. Some landlords would want a letter from your accountant to serve as an ""employment letter"" since you can write whatever nonsense you want and say you earn X amount this basically certifies the tax returns you are providing.

In summary, I wouldnt' jump through too many hoops right now because landlords are extremely desperate there is no need. Just be upfront and make sure you qualify for the apartment with the 40x requirement based off your actual income. If you are simply projecting income that doesn't fly.

Also having a guarantor either a real person or one of the guarantor companies will solve all of your problems. Personally that's the route I would go to guarantee I get the apartment.",0

I began looking at new places and as soon as I found one I liked I made a low-ball offer to see what happens.

I did not get attached to any one apartment I just made a bunch of offers to apartments I liked to see what the market was like. I did not negotiate for concessions but instead negotiated actual rent and for two years.

A few places refused to negotiate and barely lowered rent from their 2018 standards so I ignored those. A few others negotiated to my low-ball offer.

I found a place much lower, 2 bed at 1700 and accepted the offer.

My current landlord then offered to stay at $2000 about a month later which I refused. Now the place will remain open for a while.

So find places you like and make low-ball offer to them. Check the listings around to see how low rents can go.

Also do not pay a fee. Seriously. If a landlord is making the tenant pay the fee that apartment should stay open forever.",0

My suggestion is **not** that people should _always_ avoid getting tested.

I stand by my example of couch potatoes who never see people generally shouldn't bother getting tested. Each test costs _someone_ (or more realistically, some government/insurer) ~$100 which is actually non-trivial. To do some napkin math, there's something like 330 million people in the US currently. If every person gets tested once per month for a year, that'd be 3.96 billion tests. If each of those tests costs $100, the cost would be $396 billion. If each of those tests costs $10, that'd be $39.6 billion. Both are enormous numbers.

"&gt;	Because u/nypd employees are too busy jerking each other off to QAnon, it‚Äôs somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it‚Äôs not okay for us to confront you.


It‚Äôs literally not enforceable. Not on the subway. Especially not as a general policy. 

Millions live in NY and ride the subway every day. 427 stations in the system with multiple entrances. 

There are approximately 1200 cops patrolling the entire system (+ some special plainclothes teams intended for more serious crimes I assume). 

Somebody can come in with a mask then take it off while on the subway. People pull down their masks for a few seconds or minutes. 

They‚Äôve been instructed to offer a free mask before issuing any fines. So, once again, someone could put on the mask and take it off later. 

All of these facts don‚Äôt include the conservation about prioritization. Focusing our time on enforcing a mask mandate is a waste of time (imo). Especially when we‚Äôve seen more violent crimes committed on the subway in recent months (stabbings, pushing onto tracks, etc.). 

Furthermore, we‚Äôve only discussed the subway so far. Mask mandates are even more difficult (if possible at all) to enforce outdoors. We‚Äôve made outdoor dining permanent, which requires people to remove their masks. Someone could walk down the street or sit in a park while ‚Äúeating a bag of chips‚Äù for two hours to avoid wearing a mask. Just have a bottle of water with them and say their mask is down because they were just drinking water. So many other reasonable excuses. 

Finally, based on your sentiment and generalizations towards the cops in this post, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say you‚Äôre in favor of defunding the cops (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). If so, more prioritization will be needed. Violent crimes and emergencies will be far more important than mask adherence. Once again, ~1200 for a system with 427 stations (some are very large like TS and GC) and ~5,000,000 people a day. Fining every individual who doesn‚Äôt wear a mask is just impractical. 

&gt;	it‚Äôs somehow okay for you to go maskless and potentially infect us, but it‚Äôs not okay for us to confront you.

Who are you referring to? The cops who don‚Äôt wear masks or the riders? It sounds like your talking about the riders. 

If so, nothing is stopping you from confronting them lol. That‚Äôs not a smart decision but it‚Äôs a decision you are allowed to make. People tell you not to confront them because the absolute best case scenario is they‚Äôll ignore you or tell you to fuck off. But go ahead.

The issue with the PAEA is that unlike every other companies in existence, 1/ USPS has no ability to cancel it's retiree medical benefits (only Congress can), and 2/ the USPS was made to jump start that fund over a 10 years period (which is absurdly short).

2) call 311 and file a complaint. (nothing will happen)

3) call the cops for noise disturbance. There are city ordinances that specifically prohibit this sort of thing. Expect the cops to take hours to get there but they will eventually arrive and tell them to leave. After a few times they will get tickets and not come back. 

4) File a complaint with your co-op board and if need be stop paying maintenance until they produce a solution. Document EVERYTHING. With regards to the co-op you most likely will need to get neighbors on your side. If no one cares but you why should the building care?",0

Cuomo stated this week he is going to request the national guard to man the airports as well as additional police presence to randomly check incoming passengers for test results. To be honest I think he is full of shit but it APPEARS he will try to enforce this a little more than the 14 quarantine debacle. I suspect there will be heavy presence during Thanksgiving week specifically and also during christmas but other than that I wouldn't worry. Covid testing is free this shouldn't be a burden on anyone to get a test...so just go do it before you fly in! The follow up test will be exponentially harder for them to enforce.,0

The attitude here is more relaxed than months ago obviously but we're still not at the careless levels much of the country is in and with people putting little to no effort into avoid getting or spreading it (not wearing masks, visiting friends and family all the time, attending Trump rallies mask-less, etc.) while at the same time their infection rates are much higher right now.",0

"Well, as far as freedom of speech goes, Democrats have advocated for censorship on multiple different occasions. For instance, Joe Biden wants to get rid of Section 230, which is key to freedom of speech on the Internet.

[https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/](https://reason.com/2020/01/17/joe-biden-wants-to-destroy-free-speech-on-social-media/)

Freedom of religion is not about ""protecting people from the religions of others,"" it's about preventing governments from practicing religion and criminalizing others from practicing religion. A government cannot establish a religion, it must be secular. It's typically defined as: ""a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.""

Thus, it is in the free speech of people to practice (within their own private company) discriminatory practices. By virtue of the free market, businesses that practice discriminatory policies would not get lots of customers and would have to adjust in order to survive as a business. This is all included in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Higher taxes aren't doing anything when we're already trillions of dollars in debt. Instead of just collecting more taxpayer money, we should reinvest this into good healthcare, ending poverty and hunger. We have a lot more money than you think. Also, higher taxes = worse economy and worse economy = more unemployment and more unemployment = more poverty and hunger. Lower taxes would better help ameliorate poverty and hunger in this country.

That list is not at all accurate for the reasons I outline in my previous comment. Scandinavia is ranked on the Economic Freedom Index to actually be higher than the U.S. meaning that it is, in fact, more capitalist. Unless you think the U.S. is socialist, then Scandinavia and all of Western Europe is very much capitalist. You're confusing capitalism + a few regulations to make sure it's kept in check and socialism, which is when everything is owned by the government/people. That's a completely different system, and more in line with Zimbabwe/Venezuela/Yugoslavia type systems.

Also, my last paragraph did not include any ad hominems. I merely claimed that Trump has not turned America into an authoritarian oligarchy, as you claim he did and wants to. His system is just as liberal and democratic, as any other president (with the exception of Nixon and Bush). I'm also not ""alt-right."" I'm not sure why you get this impression, as I would consider myself to be a centrist, possibly leaning towards the left. I'm pro-choice, pro-free healthcare, pro-immigration, anti-death penalty, pro-same sex marriage, and anti-war on terrorism.",0

It was a good time in history to reverse the damage done by the iraq war and the financial crisis and set up protections against that happening again. That never happened. The ACA barely got passed and it‚Äôs routinely on the chopping block, it was also a middle ground and clearly should‚Äôve been more progressive if it was going to try and be repealed by any right wing candidate. He also expanded the surveillance state resulting in Snowden being a whistleblower who Obama condemned as a traitor. The police aggression issues were a hotbed issue toward the end of his presidency and the changes made did almost nothing to solve the problem. He had a tremendous chance to swing decades of American history for the better and didn‚Äôt seize the opportunity IMO",0

"**Part 1 of 2:**

* **Brenan Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who‚Äôve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected $9 billion budget shortfall.**
* **Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving companies and tech start-ups tracking smartphones all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year.**
* **For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined.**

Like many before him, [Brenan Hefner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenanhefner/) arrived in New York 20 years ago in search of a career on Wall Street.

His journey will sound familiar to those drawn to the nation‚Äôs financial capital. Hefner got a job at an asset management firm in Manhattan, found love and career success, and eventually moved to Pelham, an upscale town in Westchester, to start a family.

He would still be there if it wasn‚Äôt for the coronavirus pandemic. When Hefner, co-founder of a research platform called [Analyst Hub](https://www.analysthub.com/), sold his house this summer to a couple from London, he wondered if it made sense to look beyond the surrounding neighborhoods for a new home. He ended up moving his family to Dallas last month.

Hefner is one of thousands of high earners who‚Äôve left New York this year, an exodus that is deepening concerns over a projected [$9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-faces-toughest-fiscal-crisis-since-the-1970s-11598205600) budget shortfall. While the city is no longer the national virus hotspot it was earlier this year, those leaving cite anxiety over the region‚Äôs economy and quality of life and a conviction that higher taxes are coming. Last month, business leaders [publicly upbraided](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/nyregion/de-blasio-economy-coronavirus.html) Mayor Bill De Blasio for ‚Äúdeteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs.‚Äù

By forcing the mass adoption of remote work and crimping many of the advantages of urban life, the pandemic has turbocharged migration from high cost, high-density places to lower-cost states including Texas, Florida and Nevada. Nearly half of New Yorkers earning more than $100,000 a year said they considered leaving the city recently, with cost of living being the top factor, according to a Manhattan Institute [survey](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/survey-nyc-high-income-earners-future-work-and-quality-life).

‚ÄúThe cost of living down here is significantly less,‚Äù Hefner said by phone from his new home. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no state income tax. I‚Äôm not riding mass transit during the middle of a global pandemic to get to a subway to live in a [WeWork](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/wework-says-it-will-file-request-to-withdraw-its-ipo-prospectus-after-roadshow-management-turmoil.html) or something.‚Äù

For Brenan, the pandemic showed that for those in financial services, the gravitational pull of New York still exists, but is far weaker. He says he is about as effective operating his business over Slack and Zoom, and plans on flying to New York monthly for client meetings. His company, founded in 2018, helps star Wall Street analysts leave big banks to form independent research shops.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs a requirement to be in the city anymore,‚Äù Hefner said. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt love the city, I do. It‚Äôs an amazing place, but as far as a family of five, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the right place for us at this time.‚Äù

## ‚ÄòEverybody‚Äôs leaving‚Äô

Even within his 19-person start-up, Brenan has company. [Caroline Goodson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-goodson-33917927/), his director of corporate access and sales, left Manhattan after a homeless encampment popped up outside her apartment building. She also moved to Dallas.

His co-founder [Michael Kronenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-kronenberg-4a352815/), who owns a downtown Manhattan apartment, has spent most of the pandemic outside of New York, renting a succession of houses in places including Scottsdale, Arizona; Vail, Colorado and Sullivan‚Äôs Island, South Carolina. For senior finance professionals not chained to a trading floor, moving to lower-tax states has never been more appealing, he said.

‚ÄúEverybody I know is leaving,‚Äù Kronenberg said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just New Yorkers. My partners, long-time clients and investors of mine that live in Connecticut or New Jersey, they are used to commuting in to the city. They‚Äôre never going to commute in five days a week ever again.‚Äù

The coronavirus pandemic has caused the worst global economic crisis in living memory and taken 230,000 American lives so far, with New York City claiming one-tenth that grim figure. Downtown and midtown business districts are still a shadow of their former selves, depriving local businesses and the city of much needed revenue. A [record](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/30/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage) daily case count in the U.S. and surges in Europe have New Yorkers bracing for a tough winter.

But since moving trucks began clogging city streets this summer, New Yorkers have been incensed by the idea that the place De Blasio refers to as the ‚Äúgreatest city in the world‚Äù is on the cusp of a multi-year decline. An ex-hedge fund manager‚Äôs LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nyc-dead-forever-heres-why-james-altucher/) that declared ‚ÄúNYC is Dead Forever‚Äù prompted a withering [response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/opinion/jerry-seinfeld-new-york-coronavirus.html) from Jerry Seinfeld.

Many of those who remain say the city is more livable than before, with streets closed off to car traffic and restaurants taking up more outdoor space. Of course, the city has bounced back from every calamity in its history, from the 1918 Spanish flu to the suburban flight of the 1970s, the terror attacks of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.",0
"Part 2 of 2:

## Falling rents

But it‚Äôs hard to deny the signs of pain ahead. Data from the U.S. Postal Service, national moving [companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/new-yorkers-flee-for-florida-and-texas-as-mobility-surges) and tech start-ups tracking [smartphones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/upshot/who-left-new-york-coronavirus.html) all show an elevated outflow from New York City this year. More than 246,000 New Yorkers filed a change-of-address [request](https://abc7ny.com/7-on-your-side-investigates-pandemic-exodus-leaving-nyc-fleeing-new-york-city/6386411/) to zip codes outside the city since March, almost double the year-earlier period, for instance.

That‚Äôs reduced demand for Manhattan apartments, where median monthly rents [fell](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-real-estate.html) 7.8% to $2,990 in the third quarter, part of a city-wide decline not seen since 2010, according to StreetEasy.

To be sure, the New York area‚Äôs suburbs have been the primary beneficiary of the exodus: Home sales in Westchester jumped 112% in July, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. Sales in Greenwich, Connecticut just had the strongest [quarter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/greenwich-home-purchases-soar-to-a-decade-high-on-nyc-exodus) in more than a decade.

For those in finance, the simple math of lower tax regimes is hard to ignore. New York state levies 8.8% on wages for high earners, and New York City takes another 3.9%, or nearly 13% combined. Meanwhile, states including Florida, Texas and Nevada don‚Äôt tax wages. The more people make, the greater the incentive there is to leave, and the difference could easily mean hundreds of thousands more dollars in after-tax pay.

That‚Äôs a trade that some Wall Street titans have already made. Hedge fund billionaire [Paul Singer](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/09/13/paul-singer-on-the-markets.html) is moving the headquarters of Elliott Management to Florida from midtown Manhattan, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-21/singer-s-41-billion-hedge-fund-moving-headquarters-to-florida) this month. His move follows that of another billionaire, famed corporate raider Carl Icahn, who made the switch [last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/carl-icahn-is-said-to-be-heading-to-florida-for-lower-tax-rates) to avoid New York taxes.

## Busiest in 40 years

‚ÄúMy concern isn‚Äôt that they‚Äôre leaving, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre taking their businesses with them,‚Äù said [Mark Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-klein-370901ba/), a New York-based tax attorney and chairman of Hodgson Russ. The flight of business owners is worrying for those remaining in the city, he said.

Still, it has kept him busy. Klein says he has ten times more clients now than pre-pandemic, helping advise people who make more than $800,000 a year move to low-tax states, often bringing their businesses along. Besides hedge funds, Klein said that a spectrum of professional services operators are leaving, including public relations and accounting firms.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been as inundated with people leaving New York and Connecticut, any of these high-tax states, in my 40 years of doing this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce Covid hit, with the recognition that people can work from any location, the floodgates opened.‚Äù

The stakes are higher in an election year, with many in finance convinced that higher taxes are coming if [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/) wins and Democrats take the Senate. Within [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GS), multiple traders have told me they are voting for Biden ‚Äúagainst their own financial interests‚Äù because of his stated plan to raise taxes on those earning more than $400,000 ‚Äì an easy threshold to exceed on Wall Street.

And to a person, high-earners I spoke with said that the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions from President Trump‚Äôs 2018 overhaul hurt them personally and believe that local governments are going to seek more money from them in coming years.

Leavers aren‚Äôt limited to hedge fund traders and portfolio managers; New York is also home to a growing ecosystem of fintech firms.

When fintech CEO [Paraag Sarva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/psarva/) bought a weekend home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania last year, he figured he‚Äôd probably rent it out most of the time. But months into the pandemic, after it became clear that full-time, in-person schooling in New York was unlikely for his small children, he made it his permanent residence.

His new neighborhood, studded with horse farms and multi-acre estates, is vastly different from his old home by the expressway in Brooklyn. Two other families from New York have moved in recently, he said, and they have brought their businesses.

His start-up, [Rhino](https://www.sayrhino.com/), which replaces renters‚Äô security deposits with a small recurring fee, is still based in Manhattan. But Sarva rarely returns; he has managed the firm‚Äôs [explosive growth](https://medium.com/@psarva/the-new-normal-what-covid-19-is-teaching-our-team-53adb0abc57f) from afar. During the summer, the company doubled its employee count to 90 and raised $14 million in additional capital.

While schooling and quality of life were the main drivers of his move, the lifelong New Yorker wasn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúleave money on the table.‚Äù His taxes are 10% lower in Pennsylvania, he figures.

‚ÄúOnce we made the decision, we did consult our tax and legal advisors on what exactly that would mean,‚Äù Sarva said. ‚ÄúI am officially a Pennsylvania resident. I voted here, registered my car here, have a Pennsylvania driver‚Äôs license. I‚Äôve moved out of my former home and have no intention of returning.‚Äù

## ‚ÄòLess boring‚Äô

In some finance circles, even people who may not have permanently uprooted their families like Hefner or Sarva are pushing for a tax break. They are typically city dwellers who moved full time to their second homes once the pandemic struck.

‚ÄúThere are a bunch of people I know trying to get out of the NYC tax, they‚Äôre living in the Hamptons, Westchester, Connecticut or New Jersey,‚Äù said a managing director at a major global investment bank. Another colleague who worked mostly in New York moved her residence to Delaware, he said. He declined to be identified speaking frankly about taxes.

The executive owns condos in Manhattan and houses in Sag Harbor, but has spent most of the pandemic in New Jersey. After a three-hour meeting with his tax consultant, he plans on filing taxes as a Jersey resident to avoid New York‚Äôs 3.9% city tax. He and his friends are [risking an audit](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/09/14/new-york-city-income-tax-coronavirus-squawk-box.html), which can happen three years after he files his 2020 taxes.

In the meantime, he‚Äôs worried that his expensive Manhattan properties will lose as much as 40% in value in the coming years.

‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs gonna feel sorry for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe good news is, maybe the city will get less boring.‚Äù",0

Between internet going out multiple times a day, severe 10-20% packet loss, and like periods of week long instability, it's a total non-starter. Literally I can't work without internet.   


Optimum? Well anyone who has dealt with them knows how they operate. You call no one helps you. You get jerked around, told someone will call you back, you never get a call back.  So you complain on their ads and eventually their social media team tries. Though eventually that falls through. The technician says yeah it's the tap, then they have another guy come out to argue it isn't, and back and forth we go.   


Someday, I'm going to document in full how insane my dealings with them has been. But I'll just give a snippet of the last month. So 9/19 they were going to send a technician out to fix my internet. Waited the entire Saturday, watched the tracker like a hawk. Said they wouldn't be out until like 7pm. Still was at home, 3:30pm suddenly nothing is on the tracker, I reach out to the social team like what the hell. Get told he said I wasn't there, I'm like my wife, dog and I are right by the door all day, there's been no one home. So the social team after a lot of push back admits he lied, gives me a service credit for my troubles. Awesome.   


But wait a month later, I see credit is 43.00 and the missed service appointment is $80 on my bill. I'm like what the fuck. So my wife decides to handle it. She calls them, gets a guy named Waleed, he says he'll help and it's taken care of we'll see the bill change in two days. Great! No, nothing changed two days later. So my wife calls again. She gets told by this billing person they can't do anything, but a manager will call her. She never gets the call. So she calls again after the 48 hours. Gets told this time she has to go to the Optimum store. So she asks for a manager because she doesn't think it's great to go to a crowded store in a pandemic. Manager says you have to go to the store. She goes to the Optimum store. Optimum store says you have to go to billing. And then billing says they can't help her. So we go to retentions to get it removed since she was  told they fix things. They did not. Her process in this was like 20 hours of her time.   


That's not including my 40 proceeding hours getting them to attempt to fix something before we finally said fuck it we're moving, it's too expensive to lose my job because internet.   I hate them.

"No, VAS plates do not allow you to run any lights. They don‚Äôt give any privileges what so ever. If you are an ambulance service you have to register with the state DOH all of your emergency response vehicles. They give you a orange sticker to put in the window denoting EMS emergency vehicle status, but this also makes said vehicle subject to ‚Äúpart 800‚Äù DOH inspections. There is a state DOH EMS authority that can literally pull over ambulances/response vehicles and inspect them/put them out of service in case of violations.

EMS can have unmarked cars but it‚Äôs usually reserved for on call supervisors who don‚Äôt want to advertise to the whole world they are in a response vehicle while going about their day and the state really doesn‚Äôt like to approve them. Most agencies only have a handful of unmarked cars for chief level and above supervisors. They are required to meet minimum equipment standards and can be inspected at an time.

The Long Island counties do allow for green ‚Äúcourtesy lights‚Äù for the volunteers in their personal cars, but they can only be used when one is formally dispatched to an assignment and I believe they don‚Äôt allow you to run red lights or speed. A buddy of mine who is the chief of a volly in Long Island has had to pick up more than one over eager young EMT after the troopers towed their car for misusing courtesy lights.

Hatzola, shomrim, etc are just so used to doing whatever the fuck they want due to state authorities having a hands off approach with them.",0

We had to do a test run in Herald Square at about 2 am and needed to line up for the parade at about 6, so someone decided that taking 200 kids to that McDonalds for a ""breakfast"" at 3 am was a great idea.

Only one couple stayed in there after 200 kids walked in and my friends and I somehow ended up sharing their table. They were maybe 25 years old and very, very fucked up. The woman was gorgeous but she was so god damn high and her makeup was smeared all over her face that she looked a mess. We were there for about an hour to allow everyone to get food and eat and for that entire hour she tried to impart wisdom on us. Stuff like ""don't fuck around with boys who won't hold your hair while you puke,"" it was great. She was so sad when we had to leave and get back on the bus.

Sure, constructing market rate housing may ease the pressure on real estate prices. Ultra luxury high rises are not the answer is though, unless you're a billionaire.

As for ""Supply generates its own demand?"" - of course it does (when it comes to real estate). People want to live where the people and businesses are. That's why cities are expensive to begin with.

I‚Äôm sorry that a decentralized republic carved into 50 different autonomous pieces did not respond as quickly as one of the most culturally disciplined and systematic countries in the world.

My only point is that the seeding of covid in this country was inevitable and due to the nature of the culture the federal response will always be handicapped. I am not giving Trump a pass for his failings, but there is no mainstream politician who would have handled this any better. In the end it was the governors who are ultimately responsible for the deployment and decision making in their respective states and they are as much at fault as the feds are for this disaster.

Trump fucked up with masks. But the much more direct and measurable aspect of the outcome was the regionalized healthcare response and infection control. Especially around vulnerable populations i.e nursing homes.

The president and congress likely don‚Äôt have the authority to order local nursing homes to take or not take in covid patients. Only the state executive can do that through local emergency powers. Given that AT LEAST 40% of deaths came from nursing homes, I will lay the blame for those cases at the ultimately bumbling response of many governors who were more interested in point fingers and juxtaposing themselves against someone easily condemnable instead of being held accountable for the crisis unfolding in front of them. The federal government will NEVER have the sophistication and knowledge to execute responses at the local level. This country is simply not set up that way.

If this is too nuanced of a take for you then fine. You‚Äôre looking to give power to an equally incompetent and corrupt group of people merely because they are slightly more sophisticated in their presentation. Enjoy being just another cringey anti trumper willingly ignoring the real problems with our system because it‚Äôs easier to hate than it is to be productive.

Joe Biden is demonstratively better. By simply wearing a mask and encouraging others to do the same. From a safe distance while his supporters **sit in their fucking cars and honk their horns.*** Because he knows squishing people together in a crowd isn‚Äôt in the public interest. Because he accepts the science. He believes experts. He doesn‚Äôt degrade them and call them idiots.

"Oh I know there's been people gathering and walking. But their efficacy is questionable at best (my 2c). 

And yes, you are right that in theory SCOTUS is supposed to be that way. A lot of our government is supposed to theoretically function according to certain rules and norms. What actually happens isn't that, and I think for a lot of people it doesn't matter. If any form of government matters, it would be any executive position (the face, the most visible parts) followed by a distant 2nd being legislators followed by an even more distant 3rd in the judiciary. This plays out in every single election - voters turn out and money is spent way more on those three in that order, descending. 

Something like lifetime appointments is certainly something worth criticizng and debating, but youre talking to someone who thinks the entire theory of US government is hot garbage that needs to be thrown away, if I may be blunt. The constitution is frankly stupid. No reason to be poetic. its bad. its dumb. There are better ways to do liberal democracy, and there's no reason why we can't adapt new ideas (I'm being rhetorical, there are plenty of reasons, but theyre all steeped in cynicism and ""power is corrupt"")

My points mostly is that something like a scotus confirmation is something that simply does not register on most peoples radar. Most people want the classics - stable job and housing etc. Even if you draw a throughline from SCOTUS appointments to day-to-day action (which you certainly can) it wont matter because at the end of the day, SC Justices aren't telling local legislators and executives to do stuff. Frankly they dont evne tell local judges and prosecutors to do stuff. Thus, most people aren't going to be compelled to march on the street because Amy Coney Barrett is a new justice.",0

But we didn't.  Bc the trump admin treated this as a political crisis, not a public health crisis.  Cuomo and even that idiot di blasio were calling out the feds for not only fucking up by not having testing ready, but actually blocking state and local authorities from having ability to do their own tests.

Whatever you think of the cuomo nursing home situation, know this... we wouldn't have been in that position had trump just done his job and got out of the way to let the experts prepare this country for what was coming.",0

"None of what you said has anything to do with Cuomo hiding the number of nursing home deaths in New York.

You're literally using the same deflection strategy Cuomo does when he is asked for transparency. 

&amp;#x200B;

The federal government's many failures in responding to COVID-19 is not mutually exclusive to state-level failures, and furthermore, has absolutely nothing to do with Cuomo refusing to disclose the actual numbers.

What does Trump have to do with Cuomo hiding his state's nursing home death statistics? Is the White House somehow preventing the New York Health Dept. from being honest with their data?

&amp;#x200B;

Cuomo peddles in disinformation by comparing NY's official numbers to other states, considering NY uses a different metric than literally the entire country which under-counts by design.

And it is amusing to see Cuomo claiming the push for accountability and transparency is a political hit from Trump and ""right-wing media"" when local news outlets, AP, and ProPublica, among others, have been asking the same questions for months.",0

"That article was published 7 months ago.......

Why do lockdown skeptics insist on showing old information and assume it's still relevant today? 7 months ago, New York was at it's peak....the curve has clearly been flattened since then. I don't think I'm missing anything...Just look at New York's numbers TODAY, and compare it to states right now in the midwest that are experiencing massive spikes. New York was essentially one of the first states in the US to get it bad and have their spike. We've learned a lot since April. We had less resources available to us 7 months ago, we've learned more about the virus itself. Of course cases were going to spike. But the virus infected roughly 500,000 people in New York State. Nearly 20 million people live in New York State, 8 million of whom live in the city. The virus didn't ""run out of hosts"" like that article seems to imply. If New York hadn't taken the measures they did, many MANY more people would have gotten infected. Info from 7 months ago doesn't really represent where we are at today. Our worst point was over half a year ago. Just look at the data, it doesn't lie. Clearly the midwest states have failed to learn from New York's experience earlier this year. New York has every reason to be doing horrible right now, given the dense population in the New York City area, and the use of public transit, and yet despite all of that, the infection rate remains around 1%. The other states have 0 excuse to be doing as bad as they are right now.",0

If we assume their *best* months at 24 million a month the whole year, that's 288 million dollars.  That is best case scenario.  Yes, a lot of money.  But still less than 1% of a [32.5 billion dollar a year budget](https://leg.colorado.gov/explorebudget/)

See how that massive tax prediction just fell short in just a few minutes?

I'm sure each early voting site is staffed slightly differently.

I'm guessing there are other expenses like paper, pens, tech, voting machines, etc. as well. Then training of the polling site workers.

**What Will New York Real Estate Look Like Next Year?**

City planners, developers and local officials weigh in on how the pandemic could change the city‚Äôs housing markets, land use and policy.

The economic collapse fueled by the pandemic could reshape New York‚Äôs real estate industry, from public and affordable housing all the way to the overbuilt luxury condominium market.

**By**¬†[**David W. Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-w-chen)¬†**and**¬†[**Stefanos Chen**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/stefanos-chen)

One in five New York City tenants did not pay rent in September, by one estimate, and there is growing concern of ‚Äúan eviction tsunami.‚Äù

As apartment vacancies climb, sale prices and¬†[rents are falling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/realestate/new-york-rental-market.html), but nowhere near the magnitude needed to compensate for scarce affordable housing options.

And while the flight of affluent residents to the suburbs appears to be overstated, major companies are downsizing and fewer people are commuting, setting the stage for a new reckoning over personal and business priorities.

Real estate is everyone‚Äôs business in New York City. The industry generated nearly $32 billion in taxes last year, 53 percent of the city‚Äôs tax revenue, and it employed more than 275,000 people, according to the Real Estate Board of New York and labor statistics. An inveterate source of obsession, envy and frustration, real estate colors the aspirations and agendas of countless people, companies and policymakers.

So how the industry weathers an unparalleled economic collapse fueled by a global pandemic will reshape not just the chronically underfunded public housing system and the overbuilt luxury condominium market, but also virtually every aspect of urban life.

To assess what might happen in the next year or two, The New York Times interviewed nearly 50 people, including former senior city officials, real estate executives, affordable housing advocates, urban planners and brokers.

When will the real estate market recover, and what will it look like in terms of supply, demand, and prices?

Will New Yorkers be more open to development in their neighborhoods, or will they be even more resistant?

How will housing, transportation, retail and commercial real estate be affected in the broader New York region?

The outlook is daunting. Unemployment in New York City¬†[is still 14 percent](https://labor.ny.gov/stats/pressreleases/pruistat.shtm), after hitting 20 percent in June and July. The hotel occupancy rate¬†[is 39 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/nyc-tourism-coronavirus.html), down from 95 percent this time last year, according to the research firm STR. Roughly one-third of the city‚Äôs 240,000 small businesses¬†[may never reopen](https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf), and¬†[iconic retailers like Neiman Marcus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/realestate/how-will-hudson-yards-survive-the-pandemic.html)¬†are closing.

Residential real estate sales plummeted¬†[40 percent in July, and 57 percent in August](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-18-september-28-2020/), compared to 2019, according to the New York City Comptroller‚Äôs Office. Commercial sales were¬†[down 28 and 43 percent in July and August, compared to last year](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-by-the-numbers-weekly-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-no-11-july-27-2020/).

Still, many experts predict that New York will eventually bounce back ‚Äî as it always does, citing the eventual rebounds after the Great Recession, 9/11 and the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.

**What Will Happen to the Market?**

Rents and sale prices will continue to drop in the next year, significantly so in some areas, but likely not for the people who need relief most.

Rents in the New York metro area ‚Äî including parts of New Jersey and White Plains ‚Äî are projected to drop 7.7 to 11.3 percent by the middle of next year, from the first quarter of 2020, according to Andrew Rybczynski, a managing consultant with CoStar Advisory Services, a commercial real estate data provider.

After the 2008 recession, rents fell nearly 10 percent in Manhattan because of high unemployment and rising vacancies, said Nancy Wu, an economist with the listing website StreetEasy.

The median rental price in Manhattan, including concessions, was $3,036 a month in September, according to the brokerage Douglas Elliman. That is an 11 percent drop from the same period a year ago, but still far beyond the means of most New Yorkers. Citywide, the median rent last year was $1,467 a month, according to the New York University Furman Center.

Rents will continue to drop citywide, in the absence of a vaccine, Ms. Wu said, but that trend masks affordability problems in several neighborhoods hit hard by the coronavirus.

In¬†[an analysis](https://streeteasy.com/blog/covid-19-nyc-rents/)¬†of neighborhoods with the lowest rates of infection ‚Äî affluent neighborhoods like Battery Park City and SoHo in Manhattan ‚Äî rents dropped 1.9 percent from February to July, largely because of rising vacancies. In the hardest hit neighborhoods ‚Äî including East Elmhurst in Queens and Fordham in the Bronx ‚Äî rents have actually increased 0.3 percent in the same period, and a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic renters, many in the service industries, have shouldered that burden.

‚ÄúNew York has been a tale of two cities ‚Äî not just in terms of the pandemic, which is known, but also with rent affordability,‚Äù Ms. Wu said, noting the dearth of options on the lower end of the market.

In sales, the boroughs beyond Manhattan are expected to recover sooner, because they are relatively less expensive, and proximity to Midtown is no longer a top priority. In August, Brooklyn¬†[exceeded the pace of sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/realestate/brooklyn-real-estate-sales.html)¬†recorded the same time last year, and Queens is on a similar but slower trajectory, according to StreetEasy.

Discounts of under 10 percent are widespread, but prices have yet to plummet, except in the ultraluxury tier. Buyers waiting for fire sale prices may be disappointed, because the market was already three years into a price correction before Covid-19, Ms. Wu said.

It is less clear what will happen in the saturated new-development market. Out of more than 20,000 condo units citywide that have come to market since 2018, nearly 60 percent remain unsold, said Kael Goodman, the chief executive of Marketproof, a real estate data company. That represents $33 billion of unsold apartments, and about 2,000 of those units have not yet even begun sales.

So far, the glut of new luxury inventory has not resulted in many distressed sales, in which units may be sold in bulk to investors at deep discounts. To avoid foreclosure, some scenarios could involve converting condos to rentals, or restructuring loan obligations. Industry observers expect to see more of these actions in the months to come, as developers run out of options to satisfy lenders.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ‚ÄòRoad Runner‚Äô dynamite scenario: The fuse is burning, but it hasn‚Äôt blown,‚Äù Mr. Goodman said. ‚ÄúWhichever way things break, there will be buildings that will have to be traded.‚Äù

**What Happens to Real Estate‚Äôs Political Clout?**

In recent years, the real estate industry‚Äôs clout¬†[has waned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/nyregion/real-estate-industry-nyc.html)¬†as local legislators have leaned increasingly to the left, and campaign contributions from the Real Estate Board of New York¬†[have shriveled](https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/9565-campaign-donations-real-estate-lobby-drop-dramatically-democrats-decline-new-york). In July,¬†[progressive challengers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/progressive-primaries-ny-legislature.html), like Zohran Kwame Mamdani, a housing counselor, toppled incumbents viewed as too moderate.

City and state legislators are mulling an apartment vacancy tax and other measures to discourage speculative investment, while opponents warn of a ‚Äúdeath spiral,‚Äù in which over-taxation could scare away the wealthy. The highest-earning¬†[1 percent of New York City residents](https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/nycs-high-income-tax-habit/)¬†generated 43 percent of city income taxes and 51 percent of state income taxes collected from individuals living in the city as of 2016, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank.

But more than any statistic or legislation, the most consequential factor for real estate is what will happen on June 22, 2021.

That is the date of New York City‚Äôs next primary election, and it will be the most consequential since 2013, when Bill de Blasio, bolstered by his¬†[‚Äútale of two cities‚Äù campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/nyregion/de-blasio-shifts-away-from-his-re-election-message-of-one-city.html), swept into office. Now, with term limits forcing out a deeply unpopular Mayor de Blasio, along with most of the City Council,¬†[a wide-open battle for the city‚Äôs leadership](https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9596-who-is-running-for-what-office-2021-new-york-city-elections-mayor-city-council)¬†is underway. And real estate interests say the stakes have never been higher.

The city‚Äôs next mayor will need to address urgent land use and housing issues that have dogged the current administration even in a time of prosperity and freewheeling spending. A¬†[$9 billion budget shortfall looms.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/nyregion/nyc-budget-coronavirus.html)

Depending on what happens in the presidential election, it is too early to gauge whether voters will opt for, say, a technocrat like former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg or a rising progressive like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. One presumed favorite, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson,¬†[has already bowed out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/nyregion/corey-johnson-mayor-nyc.html), highlighting the unpredictable nature of the race.

‚ÄúWhat these two crises have laid bare is that this extraordinarily wealthy city which was doing so well for one segment of the population was completely failing other segments of the population, including people we now call essential workers, and communities of color, generally,‚Äù said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a former city planning official who is now dean of the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley. ‚ÄúNow how can we use this pause to think about the city that should be ‚Äî a more equitable city?‚Äù

Some power brokers, like the developer Stephen M. Ross and Daniel L. Doctoroff, a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, are¬†[already plotting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/nyregion/mayor-stephen-ross-daniel-doctoroff.html)¬†how to best use their influence and money to elevate their preferred mayoral candidate.

‚ÄúJust vote ‚Äî vote in the Democratic primary,‚Äù said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of CBRE NY Tri-State, a commercial brokerage, during a Zoom panel organized by the¬†[Partnership for New York City](https://pfnyc.org/research/a-call-for-action-and-collaboration/), an influential business group. ‚ÄúAnd get people to serve on the community boards who come from the world of business who understand the basic economics of the city.‚Äù

The city‚Äôs push to rezone SoHo, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for more affordable housing, could signal a shift in land use policy that had long favored redevelopment in less affluent communities of color.",0
"Continued...  


**What Will Happen to Big Projects?**

In light of the virus‚Äôs disastrous effects on the economy, some believed the path forward for several stalled megadevelopments would be cleared, because of their promise of new jobs and infrastructure.

Instead, opponents have grown more circumspect, and the De Blasio administration, in its waning days, could push for something critics have long demanded: rezoning in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods, not the communities of color that have often been the reluctant recipients of major redevelopment.

A large expansion of Brooklyn‚Äôs Industry City complex, which developers said would create 20,000 new jobs,¬†[was quashed last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/industry-city-rezoning-nyc.html)¬†by opponents who doubted that claim and said the project would hasten the displacement of the largely lower-income immigrant community nearby.

Also in September, the city backed out of a proposal to build up to 15 mixed-use towers on 28 acres in Long Island City, where Amazon previously failed to garner support for its New York campus, because of local concerns about gentrification and inadequate infrastructure.

The Justice for All Coalition, a community group opposed to the project, explained in a letter in July: ‚ÄúThe proposed rezoning ‚Äî for the purpose of building luxury residential and commercial mega towers ‚Äî is exactly what this community does¬†*not*¬†need in the face of Covid and the urgent issues raised by Black Lives Matter.‚Äù

Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor under Mr. de Blasio, rejected that thinking.

‚ÄúThis is not the time to double down on the narrative that business is bad, that development is bad,‚Äù said Ms. Glen, who recently started a development firm, M Squared, which builds mixed-income housing in cities across the country. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt play to the cheap seats of being against everything and everybody.‚Äù

But the disproportionate harm the virus has caused to Black and Hispanic residents in lower-income neighborhoods has emboldened another view, critics say: That the argument is not simply pro- or anti-development, but a matter of where the effort is placed, and for whom.

So the mayor‚Äôs decision this month¬†[to back a rezoning in SoHo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/nyregion/soho-affordable-housing-development.html), one of the wealthiest neighborhoods to be eyed for new affordable housing, is a significant moment, said Alex Fennell, the coordinator for the Racial Impact Study Coalition, a community advocacy group.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time the city has flat-out said, ‚ÄòWe need to put more affordable housing in affluent, white neighborhoods,‚Äô and that‚Äôs an important rhetorical shift,‚Äù Ms. Fennell said.

The proposal, which made scant mention of new housing when it was floated last year as a mostly commercial rezoning, is now seeking to allow about 3,200 new housing units to be built, including 800 below-market-rate apartments. The city has also signaled that a rezoning of Gowanus, a neighborhood in Brooklyn that is wealthier than several other neighborhoods eyed for redevelopment, is also a priority.

‚ÄúThere was an unspoken rule that you don‚Äôt rezone wealthy neighborhoods,‚Äù said Will Thomas, a board member of Open New York, a pro-housing group. While local opposition is already building, he said ‚ÄúSoHo is the first step in really showing that it‚Äôs politically possible.‚Äù

A public housing development in Chelsea. Major budget cuts are threatening both the preservation and building of new affordable housing.

**What Happens to Affordable Housing?**

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which funds and maintains much of the city‚Äôs affordable housing stock, suffered a deep cut this summer, when the city agreed to decrease its capital funding by 40 percent over two years.

Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a policy and advocacy nonprofit,¬†[estimated that¬†](http://thenyhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NYHC-Policy-Brief-City-Budget-Cuts-10.6.2020.pdf)could translate into 21,000 fewer new and preserved affordable housing units and 34,000 fewer jobs, mostly in construction and related industries. (In a reversal, the city said Thursday that it would restore about half of the funding that had been scheduled to be cut.)

The cuts could delay or derail a number of once-assured projects. In Far Rockaway, Queens, an 11-building complex called Edgemere Commons with more than 2,000 units, all of which would be offered below market rate, was scheduled to receive city financing in December, but a backlog of stalled closings this summer means their project will likely be pushed back further.

‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre in limbo,‚Äù said Daniel Moritz, a principal at Arker Companies, the developer, which planned to begin construction this year.

Millions of dollars in predevelopment costs like architectural plans, legal fees and engineers can overwhelm developers awaiting funding, said Ron Moelis, a co-founder of L+M Development Partners. His firm expected to close city financing in June on the first phase of Bronx Point, a mixed-use project in the South Bronx with 542 below-market-rate units expected to be completed by 2023. Now financing has been pushed back until at least December.

‚ÄúAt the exact moment in time when we as a city know that we should be doubling down, the city is pulling back,‚Äù said Barika Williams, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of housing organizations.

In a September survey representing about 85,000 apartments in New York, nearly 20 percent of tenants paid no rent, according to CHIP, a group that represents 4,000 landlords and managers of primarily rent-stabilized buildings.

And unemployment figures do not show the full scope of struggling renters, Ms. Williams said, because many who are out of work or are underemployed were paid in cash, and therefore not recorded by official counts. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the brink of an eviction tsunami,‚Äù she said.

Experimenting with new methods to create or preserve more affordable housing is crucial, said Rafael E. Cestero, a former housing commissioner who is now president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit housing and finance company. He urged elected officials to ‚Äúchannel more rental assistance‚Äù to the neediest New Yorkers.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt build our way out of the housing crisis,‚Äù he said.

T[he Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/be-my-neighbor)¬†estimates that 500,000 new homes, including 100,000 in New York City, can be created ‚Äî and at minimal cost ‚Äî if state and local governments make it easier for basements, garages and attics to be converted into legal dwellings.

Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is running for mayor in 2021, is among those[¬†supporting plans to convert empty offices into housing](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/brooklyn-borough-prez-calls-converting-empty-offices-housing).

Meanwhile, the New York City Housing Authority, the landlord for one in 15 New Yorkers, is¬†[exploring new ways](https://www.gothamgazette.com/open-government/130-opinion/9631-promising-new-plan-to-save-new-york-city-public-housing-nycha)¬†to shore up funding. The agency needs $40 billion to fix issues including mold, lead abatement, and deferred maintenance in its 170,000 apartments across 2,252 buildings.

"Continued...  


**Is Suburban Flight Just a Fad?**

The demise of cities is overstated, experts said, but lasting changes will become more apparent in the years to come, especially in the work force.

With many companies discouraging employees from coming into the office until mid-2021, Barry B. LePatner, a real estate lawyer, predicted that the daytime population in Manhattan‚Äôs business districts would get dramatically younger.

While older employees will be inclined to stay at home, particularly if they are juggling child care and education issues, younger ones won‚Äôt want to miss out on networking and socializing opportunities. ‚ÄúI believe this will be a generational thing,‚Äù he said.

A¬†[report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/insights/covid-19/the-edge-volume-4/urban-to-suburban-the-growing-shift-to-the-suburbs-as-covid-19-changes-the-way-people-live)¬†noted that the demand for suburban office space, ‚Äúfueled largely by aging millennials,‚Äù was already outpacing urban cores.

More than 40 percent of U.S. bank executives also plan to reduce their office footprint to accommodate a partial work-from-home schedule, according to a survey by the consulting firm Accenture.

‚ÄúThe tether between work and home just got a lot longer,‚Äù said Jonathan Miller, a New York real estate appraiser. That shift is already increasing buyer demand in more affordable markets beyond the city center.

There are signs the suburban surge is slowing, as pent-up demand diminishes and prices there reach new highs, Mr. Miller said. While sales remain elevated, suburbs like Westchester and parts of Long Island saw contract activity peak in July.

But as the last seven months have reminded everyone, nothing in real estate is guaranteed.

Scott Rechler, the chief executive of RXR Realty and chairman of the Regional Plan Association, recalled a¬†[Sept. 1990 Time magazine with a heartbroken ‚ÄúI Love New York‚Äù logo](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601900917,00.html)¬†and the headline: ‚ÄúThe Rotting of the Big Apple.‚Äù The cover story mentioned a poll in which 60 percent of New York City residents said that they wanted to leave.

‚ÄúI keep this on my desk,‚Äù said Mr. Rechler, a former vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ‚ÄúI want to remind myself that our prosperity isn‚Äôt guaranteed. We need to continually maintain the quality of life that drives people to continue to want to live and work in New York City.‚Äù

Sure thing. Just pasted it above in a few comments.,0
"&gt; We're not European are we?

In March and April our response was very much compared to the ""superior"" European response.  Europe is now handily beating America when comparing per capita vs. per capita case counts.

&gt;Canada is at 6.7. There is absolutely 0 reason our northern brothers are outdoing us besides political incompetence. 

There are many factors at play.  One of the most obvious is that America has performed about 60% more tests than Canada.  The Canadian daily average is creeping upwards and may increase at a more exponential rate at any time (much like what happened with Germany over the past two weeks).  Canada could also have better leadership as you pointed out, or a population more willing to social distance, etc.

&gt;They have the same issue of anti-masker idiots. Same culture of anti-authoritarianism. 

Lol.  Americans are wayyyyyyyyy more likely to rebuke authority, for better or worse.

&gt;Mexico is even lower, but that's probably just because of lower available tests.

Mexico has a significantly higher CFR than America does.  And the testing infrastructure is undoubtedly way worse.

My point about Europe is that even the countries that ""got it right"" are experiencing a massive wave of cases.  COVID is much harder to contain than anyone would like to admit, especially in countries and cultures that are more individualistic in nature.",0

The Strand Bookstore, an incorporated business, applied for, and obtained a PPP loan.  PPP loans can be used for:

* Payroll Costs 
* health care benefits; retirement benefits; and state and local payroll taxes not include payments made to independent contractors or sole proprietors.
‚Ä¢ Health care benefits are payments by a borrower for employee health 
* Salaries and commissions that are excluded from Payroll Costs (e.g., compensation in excess of $100,000).
* Rent (including rent under a lease agreement).
* ‚ÄúRent‚Äù includes amounts due on equipment leases and other leases of personal property.
* Utilities.
* Payments for the distribution of electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone, and internet access. Transportation costs are limited to transportation utility fees assessed by state or local government.
* Interest (but only interest) on any ‚Äúmortgage‚Äù obligation.
* Interest (but only interest) on any ‚Äúother debt‚Äù obligations that were incurred before 2/15/20.
* ‚ÄúOther debt‚Äù likely includes floorplan interest (but not curtailment) for inventory acquired before 2/15/20.
* 1 PPP proceeds may also be used for the other purposes generally allowed under SBA Section 7(a) programs. At least 60% of loan proceeds must be used for Payroll Costs (and no more than 40% for Non-Payroll Costs).

"I'm sorry you feel this way.  Everyone feels uncomfortable walking past an obviously mentally ill person, just hoping there's no confrontation.

One thing I'd recommend is to not give a fuck about hurting their feelings.

I recall reading a study long time ago about women on trains.  When a creep sat next to them making them uncomfortable, in a mostly empty car, many women would continue to sit still because of how they thought moving away would be perceived.

Don't do that.  If you feel uncomfo in anyway, run away.  Be vigilant, don't walk around with headphones at night.  Don't stand around blind corners.  Always make space between you and everyone else.  Don't give a fuck about how moving away makes someone else feel.

The odds of you being randomly targeted in a shooting is practically zero. In a moving subway car, practice moving between train cars if you've never done that before.  As long as you make space, don't hesitate to run, and carry mace, you can give yourself a little more peace of mind that you're at least prepared.  Also mentally visualizing the types of situations that could arise and how you would deal with them helps prevent freezing up in the moment.

To make matter worse, when math dept fight back saying ""we need to have standard, you cannot admit students that are not prepare for college,, you will have admin/politican/interest grp saying ""you cannot discriminate disadvantage students"". Yea, sure but how about improve your standard in grade school so that everyone graduates from high school actually, you know, have the knowledge of a high school kids.

And shes lucky I can teach her, but what about other less fortunate, what is their option? Right, there is no other option beside you will never learnt it.

At the end, the attack against Asian is just the easy way out for DOE because Asian, or I should say Chinese, never fight back and cant fight back. Until people starting to vote for people who sincerely care about education and believe in education will lead to a better future, the public school system will cont. to deteriorate. And unfortunately right now, I dont see this happening because the conversation is all about racial issue, when was the last time someone actually take about ""what is being taught""?; also, parents who can afford to send their kids to private school/ or move to better school district (eg. Long Island) will do show at a even faster way due to covid, so what is left are parents who are less affluence, which usually means nobody give a flying fuck as long as DOE ""looks progressive""",0

The decline in safety has really only happened in the Manhattan CBD, plus the UES and UWS, plus maybe a small handful of neighborhoods in northern Brooklyn. That's because offices remain closed, so no surge of office workers during the day; tourism remains dead, so no tourists roaming the streets; and many wealthy Manhattanites remain in their (even) more spacious digs out in the Hamptons or Westchester or Fairfield or wherever.

Let‚Äôs start with the good news: The iPhone 12, [the first with 5G](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-event-iphone-12-expected-with-5g-capabilities-11602581403), is indeed the fastest 5G smartphone. The speeds will knock your masks off, as we say in 2020.

Now the bad news: To see those speeds, you need to move really, really slowly. After locating your carrier‚Äôs high-speed tower, stand right next to it, tap download, then freeze.

Despite being marketed as our technological savior, 5G‚Äîthe next generation of cellular connectivity‚Äîis not a killer feature for the new iPhone 12 models. At least not in the U.S., not yet.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: The cellular speeds *can* be insanely fast. In some tests, it‚Äôs up to [30 times faster than my home broadband](https://www.wsj.com/articles/5g-smartphones-could-crush-your-home-wi-fi-so-wheres-the-5g-11597670710). Just persuade the marketing department at MetLife Stadium‚Äîhome of New York‚Äôs football teams and lots of [Verizon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ) [VZ **-0.09%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/VZ?mod=chiclets)high-speed 5G antennas‚Äîto let you work on the field. (I did; see the video.) Just bring a power pack because 5G is a battery drain.

It‚Äôs best to think of 5G as an invisible feature‚Äîsomething that might one day come in handy. What makes this the best iPhone upgrade in years are a fabulous-to-hold design and substantial camera improvements.

Even those who bought iPhone 11 models last year might pine for these new ones. That said, I‚Äôve aimed my testing and assessment at those who have been holding on to iPhones that are in the iPhone 8, X and XS families‚Äîthat is, phones that are two or three years old by now. And yes, I‚Äôm also talking to readers I‚Äôve heard from who are still clinging to a prehistoric iPhone 6 or 7.

If you‚Äôre due (or overdue) for an upgrade, opting for an iPhone 12 is a no-brainer. But to select which of the four models to get, it‚Äôs best to group them together:

**‚Ä¢ iPhone 12 Mini ($699 and up) and iPhone 12 ($799 and up)**: [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL)‚Äôs [AAPL **1.32%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL?mod=chiclets)mainstream options have 5G, a new design and an improved wide camera. (They also have an ultrawide camera already found on earlier models.) The Mini has a 5.4-inch screen; the 12 has a 6.1-inch screen‚Äîotherwise, they‚Äôre identical. The Mini is available Nov. 13; the regular 12 is available Friday.

‚Ä¢ **iPhone 12 Pro ($999 and up) and iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099 and up)**: These also have 5G but come with a slightly more premium design and a trio of cameras, including the new wide one. The iPhone 12 Pro has the same 6.1-inch screen as the iPhone 12. The Pro Max has a 6.7-inch screen, and a new telephoto camera. The Pro is available Friday; the Pro Max is available Nov. 13.

Unfortunately, because of the later ship date for the Mini and Pro Max, I was only able to test the standard 12 and 12 Pro. Meanwhile, here are your key considerations:

## Aluminum or Steel?

You know that feeling when you cut your hair and it feels dramatically different for a few days? That‚Äôs this year‚Äôs iPhone design change. The squared-off edges, the rounded corners, the clean glass back make this the best iPhone design in years. It reminds me of a slick, grown-up iPhone 5.

I actually prefer the 12‚Äôs lower-end aluminum for its lighter weight. Plus, the Pro‚Äôs flashy stainless-steel frame is a fingerprint magnet.

Speaking of magnets, Apple put some in the backside of these phones so you can snap on its new MagSafe accessories. It‚Äôs a neat trick‚Äîat least in theory. The $59 leather wallet attachment is great for storing credit cards. Except a few times, when I slid it into my jeans, the magnet detached and the wallet flew off.

Then there‚Äôs the $39 MagSafe charger. While it charged the dead iPhone 12 up to 50% in an hour‚Äîfaster than a typical Qi-compatible wireless charger‚ÄîApple‚Äôs 20-watt wired charger took just 28 minutes. Plus, it has a short cord and the USB-C charging brick is sold separately. In an effort to save the earth, Apple removed that from the box. Don‚Äôt worry, I just reviewed [some better charging options here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-chargers-for-your-iphone-12-tablet-laptop-and-other-usb-c-devices-11602689252).

Though Apple makes other MagSafe cases, you may dare to make this your first caseless iPhone in recent memory. With a new ‚Äúceramic shield‚Äù over the glass and the new flat-edge design, Apple says it has four times the drop protection. The two phones slipped off a table onto cement and both withstood the fall without any nicks or dents.

"###### Two Cameras or Three?

The biggest decision between the 12 and 12 Pro comes down to a single camera.

Both have the same ultrawide cameras, which are great for capturing a whole scene. Both also have new wide cameras, updated with a wider aperture to let in 27% more light, according to Apple. In my low-light scene tests I could see a noticeable improvement over the iPhone 11, and big improvement over the iPhone X and iPhone 8.

So what‚Äôs different? The Pro adds a telephoto camera for taking closer shots. Whenever I would switch back from the 12 Pro to the 12, I missed the flexibility of being able to zoom into a scene without disrupting the action‚Äîa big thing for people with kids and pets.

The Pro also has a new lidar sensor, which [uses lasers to capture depth information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar). This will improve augmented-reality apps but also enables Night Portrait Mode, photos with that nice blur around the subject, even in low light. It did a nice job, but Portrait Mode still generally struggles with tough backgrounds.

###### G or Bust?

To really understand why you won‚Äôt see hair-on-fire speeds when you get a new iPhone 12, you first have to know the two types of 5G in the U.S.:

**Millimeter wave:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the Verizon 5G pole, honey. Be back soon!‚Äù This is my life when testing, because the fastest 5G doesn‚Äôt come to you. You go to it.

Named after its high radio frequencies, this is the blazing-fast connection Apple was bragging about during its event. In Jersey City, when testing Verizon‚Äôs Ultra Wide Band network, I saw download speeds as high as 3,000 megabits per second‚Äî3 gigabits! That is nuts!

Yet I could only do all that when standing right next to the tower. On my stoop, a block or so away, I can manage 800 Mbps. When I‚Äôm inside, I can only get 4G. This type of 5G can‚Äôt travel long distances, and obstacles like trees and walls can slow it down.

Verizon, [T-Mobile](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS) [TMUS **0.28%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TMUS?mod=chiclets)and [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) [T **-0.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T?mod=chiclets)are putting up millimeter-wave cells in bigger cities and in public spots like stadiums and parks. That‚Äôs why I found myself at MetLife Stadium.

**Sub-6 5G:** Named for frequencies under 6 GHz, this isn‚Äôt as fast but provides far wider indoor and outdoor coverage. T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have substantial sub-6 footprints; Verizon just announced what it calls ‚ÄúNationwide 5G.‚Äù

The issue? This sort of 5G isn‚Äôt always better than 4G. Throughout the week, I saw speeds ranging from 30 Mbps to 160 Mbps on both Verizon and T-Mobile‚Äôs sub-6 networks. Sometimes the iPhone 11 Pro‚Äôs Verizon 4G connection would get the same speeds.

I wasn‚Äôt able to test AT&amp;T with the new iPhones yet, but in past AT&amp;T tests with Android phones, its sub-6 network was spottier than T-Mobile‚Äôs.

I did, however, see much higher speeds with these iPhones than with any 5G Android phones I‚Äôve tested so far.

Even when you‚Äôve got the knock-your-masks-off speed, what can you do with it?

I downloaded the first two seasons of ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù (about 4 GB) in less than 3.5 minutes on [Netflix](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX) [NFLX **-1.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX?mod=chiclets)and Apple TV, respectively, and a 2GB game in 45 seconds from the App Store. Speedier than my home broadband network, that‚Äôs for sure. Yet it took 4 minutes to pull down just one episode on [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) [AMZN **0.31%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN?mod=chiclets)Prime Video. Download time can depend as much on the service you‚Äôre using as it does the speed of your network.

Plus, the iPhone 12 got uncomfortably warm during those downloads. To the point where I had to put it down.

While video streaming and FaceTime HD also looked clearer with 5G, its best use was sharing the connection with your laptop. You won‚Äôt get phone speeds, but working from my laptop from the stadium, I was able to hit 400 Mbps.

Of course, there‚Äôs a price for this. Literally. Verizon required me to upgrade to a top unlimited plan to get the UWB service.

And then there‚Äôs the battery drain. Downloading those episodes on Verizon‚Äôs UWB network used 15% of my battery. That‚Äôs why Apple included a Smart Data Mode. Enabled by default, it uses only that high-speed network if it detects you need it.

Most people won‚Äôt be on superfast 5G, and will find the battery life on these phones to be solid. They lasted a full day of fairly heavy use‚Äîthough fell a bit shorter than the iPhone 11, which consistently leaves me with at least 15% before bed time.

A lot of this is just 5G growing pains. The carriers and Apple are betting that as the networks expand, and phones get into more hands, we‚Äôll see apps and services we can‚Äôt yet imagine‚Äîjust as 4G enabled the likes of Uber and Instagram.

If and when that happens, iPhone 12 owners will be ready. In the meantime, they‚Äôll have a pretty great iPhone.",0

"&gt;Snowden didn‚Äôt go to him randomly‚Äîhe went to him because he thought greenwald would be more likely to publish his stuff than most other reporters, since greenwald had a reputation about caring about civil liberties and not being an establishment stooge.

Snowden absolutely went to him randomly. He [happened to read a Greenwald article for Salon that he liked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/edward-snowden-nsa-secrets-glenn-greenwald-laura-poitras). If he hadn't decided to read the news that day, he would likely have selected some other reporter instead.

And it turned out Snowden was wrong about Greenwald being likely to publish his stuff. He went to Greenwald in late 2012 and Greenwald [couldn't even be arsed to speak with him](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html) (let alone do any reporting). Greenwald only got involved after Snowden went to Laura Poitras and Poitras convinced Greenwald that interviewing Snowden was worth the effort.

&gt;Greenwald has done a *lot* of great investigative reporting since, incidentally‚Äîparticularly relating the Brazilian political corruption.

I'm not disputing that Greenwald *was* \- emphasis *was* \- a great reporter. I'm only saying that (i) he lucked out when Snowden reached out to him out of the blue, (ii) he lucked out again when, despite having ignored Snowden, Snowden ended up reaching out to Poitras and Poitras looped him in anyway, and (iii) he's no longer a credible reporter, given how deeply he's dived into shilling Russian propaganda about the [""deep state"" opposing Trump](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/11/the-deep-state-goes-to-war-with-president-elect-using-unverified-claims-as-dems-cheer/) and [demonizing Hillary](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/15/12853236/glenn-greenwald-trump-clinton).

I don't know whether Greenwald's been compromised by the Russians, or if he's just doing this because he's come to personally hate America (not without reason, given the kind of harassment he and his husband have been subjected to at the border due to the U.S. and UK's interventions). But at the very least he's a useful idiot for the Russians, and for Trump.",0

In addition, the steam sauna is closed but the dry sauna is open.  Why is that?  Dry saunas operate at higher temperatures (70-100¬∞C or 158-212¬∞F) and have porous wood furniture that make it difficult for any virus to survive for long.  The CDC publishes guidelines/considerations for operating saunas during coronavirus, so we don‚Äôt have to listen to ignorant people speaking out of their asses.

Safety first! We take health and wellbeing very seriously.  Our Bathhouse has and will continue to be cleaned and sanitized on a strict schedule. All technicians and guest receiving treatments will be required to wear face masks, and can also wear gloves upon request.

Our lobby and locker rooms will be marked with social distance markers. We will be keeping it small with only 16 guests on-premises at once.  Accordingly, guests are kindly asked to adhere to a 2-hour time limit on using the amenities so that we can ensure comfortable capacity at all times. For the time being, only two people, or one group who have come in together, will be allowed in the thermo-neutral and hot pools at a time and only one person at a time in the cold plunge.  Only one party is allowed in each sauna at a time, and the steam room will be closed.‚Äù",0

"UPenn actually tried to [analyze this a bit](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/10/12/covid-trade-offs-in-school-re-opening).

To give a sense of the cost of school closures:

&gt; By October 1, 2020, we project students in grades 1-12 had lost between $43,000 and $57,000, or 4 to 5 percent of their lifetime wage earnings.

Yes, multiple percentage points of future earnings lost. Implying lower government services and a weaker economy.

Their conclusion:

&gt; Based on September‚Äôs cost per COVID case, the threshold to close schools for October (using the high end of educational harm to children) is over 0.355 new expected infections per student.

Note that that is *new* cases. 

Remember: people were catching COVID while unemployed or retired. Some portion of students and teachers would have gotten sick even with 100% remote learning.

So to correctly interpret their analysis and put it into action, one must then ascertain what impact school reopening has had on infection rates.

A number of countries have had schools open and haven't really seen an increase resulting from them. 

Those results may not replicate here, but in theory our government has contract tracing info. They can tell us how things are going in school vs outside of school.

Note that their analysis also intentionally does not take into account things like lost childcare impacting parents, mental health, and a bunch of other things that would increase the cost of remote schooling.",0

"&gt;If they can‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù

New knowledge is built on top of existing knowledge. And it requires work to maintain existing information.

It's well known that summer vacation has an impact on what students retain. Every school year we'd waste time going over existing concepts to recover what we lost before tackling new subjects.

Except now we've lost way more than just a summer vacation's worth of schooling. We have to not only catch up but learn at an even faster rate than before just to catch up to the last class.

From the [OECD paper about schooling and income loss](http://www.oecd.org/education/The-economic-impacts-of-coronavirus-covid-19-learning-losses.pdf):

&gt; Moreover, it is known from many studies (such as 
the analyses of skill development during the summer 
holidays described in the Annex A) that learning is a 
dynamic process that builds on prior learning, so that 
stagnation leads to growing deficits. Closed schools 
not only impart less new knowledge (Oreopoulos 
and Salvanes, 2011[3]), but also mean loss of already 
acquired skills on which further learning could build 
(Kuhfeld et al., 2020[4]).

Check out the studies they link to.",0

"There are many reasons why having a car in the city is difficult.

1. The city will trash your car. Be it from pot holes or parallel parking disasters (hello love tap), the city is not kind to cars. This also means leasing is a no go.
2. Cars are expensive. Even buying used, if you have a decent car, you'll be looking at least $5k per year between depreciation, maintenance, gas, insurance, parking/tickets, repairs, oil changes, tire changes, side mirror replacements, etc. If you have an expensive car, first year depreciation alone can hit $20k+. Renting a car for the odd weekend that you need it is \~$200 per.
3. Time is also valuable and spending 40-50 hours per a year looking for parking is a lot of time that might be better spent, I don't know... sleeping? And waiting in your car for parking to become legal can be painful. Tickets are worse though. If you value your free time at $20 per hour it's not cheap.
4. Getting out of the city by car is hell, especially if you're going north and need to go anywhere near the GWB.

Cars are great, I would love to have one, but I've done the math and it's just not in the cards right now. When I'm not wfh I bike to work, I get my groceries locally, and when I need a car I rent one. I have an irresponsible friend that bankrupted herself on a Mercedes SUV. She leased it had to to do extensive repairs, got a ton of tickets, had a ton of stress with alternate side of the street parking. And she drove it for non parking reasons once or twice a month.

It did not work with our 130 person venue in Long Island. His main wedding reception had over 300 people sand it was not considered a big wedding.

Other differences include the mind boggling number of events:

First of all, engagement parties are expected and in my experience can be either a year before  or the week of the wedding. Its called a Saggun and it is the first official meeting of the families.

Then you have the Mendhi, which is typically at the brides family‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs where the bride and women of the family‚Äôs get their henna done. It takes hours. Traditionally it‚Äôs ladies only, but our family has been having them as mostly co-ed catered house parties. 

Next is Jaggo Night. From what I understand, it‚Äôs a party to make noise to let the whole town know there is a wedding. The thing is, I got the invitation. It‚Äôs at a catering hall. It‚Äôs not even the first event. WE KNOW THERES A WEDDING. We flew in for fucks sake. It‚Äôs a reception.

The next event is the Sangeet it‚Äôs another reception. Why? I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not gonna google it. Put on a different Kurta so you don‚Äôt look like a Jaggoff for wearing the same outfit from last night‚Äôs reception.

Next morning you get to go to temple a little hung over for the actual wedding. This can last anywhere from 90 minutes to 8 hours. Meals are served. 

The next evening is the actual for reals reception. 

You may be asking yourself:

Is this exhausting? Yes! 

Isnt this incredibly expensive? Also yes! 

Why do families put themselves through this? FiddlerOnTheRoofTradition.gif

(Not seriously complaining. The ones we‚Äôve gone to for family have been fun and for not incredibly close friends and family of family you can skip some events)",0

"In case anyone can't read past the paywall.

&gt;The New York Police Department is forming an Asian Hate Crime Task Force, its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.

&gt;The city has seen a rise in hate crimes directed at Asian people since the coronavirus pandemic began, the NYPD said. Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who speak a combined nine Asian languages, the group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to prosecution. It will remain after the pandemic, the NYPD said.

&gt;‚ÄúWhen a victim looks at an Asian cop, they‚Äôll see, ‚ÄòOh he reminds me of my brother, or my son,‚Äô‚Äù said Stewart Loo, the NYPD deputy inspector who heads the task force. ‚ÄúIt gives them some comfort level.‚Äù

&gt;The nation‚Äôs largest police department logged 23 incidents of coronavirus hate crimes, a separate category created this year to track crimes targeting someone for their identity based on the perception that it has something to do with Covid-19. All but one targeted New Yorkers of Asian descent.

&gt;Hate crimes overall have plunged in the city, according to NYPD data. There were 206 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and Sept. 27, down 33% compared with 308 in the same period a year ago. Incidents of anti-Semitism, which account for the majority of hate crimes reported in the city, fell 50%.

&gt;Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, commanding officer of NYPD‚Äôs Hate Crime Task Force, said he wasn‚Äôt surprised when crimes rose against Asian people. The origins of the virus in China, he said, would inspire some people to irrationally blame Asian-Americans.

&gt;But what he hadn‚Äôt foreseen was the reluctance of some victims to cooperate with authorities‚Äîsome driven by fear of law enforcement, others by a lack of English proficiency, and still more who worried about their troubles going public, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúThey would not answer our phone call, they would not answer the door for us,‚Äù Mr. Molinari said.

&gt;When he discussed these problems during a virtual town hall with the public, Mr. Loo, a commanding officer at the Manhattan South Detective Bureau, reached out with a proposal: create a team of Asian-American officers to investigate crimes that involve Asian victims or witnesses.

&gt;So far, officers on the task force have been sent out to chat with Asian victims in person, and have successfully convinced some to report crimes, Mr. Loo said. The officers are loaned to the task force as needed, but also have full-time jobs elsewhere in the department.

&gt;Mr. Loo, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a child in 1983, said his father was robbed multiple times working as a delivery man for Chinese restaurants in Manhattan during the 1980s. He would serve as a translator between his dad and the police, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúI was kind of like 8 or 9 years old, trying to translate, trying to get through,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was tough.‚Äù

&gt;Those experiences partly inspired him to join the NYPD in 2000, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúWith Covid and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it‚Äôs a very uncomfortable feeling being out in public,‚Äù he said.

&gt;Coronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city except Staten Island, NYPD data showed. Manhattan has experienced the most, with 13 incidents, followed by five in Brooklyn, three in Queens and two in the Bronx. Arrests have been made in 15 cases.

&gt;In one March incident, the police said, a group of four teenage girls approached a 51-year-old woman on an MTA bus in the Bronx. The teens attacked the woman, made anti-Asian statements and struck her in her head with an umbrella before fleeing the bus. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she received stitches for a laceration to her head.

&gt;Three 15-year-old girls, who were apprehended near the scene a short time after the incident, were arrested and charged with hate-crime assaults, menacing and harassment. One teen wasn‚Äôt apprehended.

&gt;In another case in September, a man on a bicycle began yelling anti-Asian statements at a man and his female companion who were walking on Broadway in Manhattan near Union Square. The man on the bicycle then assaulted the man with his bicycle and his backpack, before fleeing on the bicycle. Nobody was injured, and no arrests were made.

&gt;Alice Wong, chief of staff at the Chinese-American Planning Council in New York City, said many of her friends and family started fearing for their safety after the pandemic hit. Some people blamed Asians for the virus, or would avoid Asian people or businesses out of a misguided fear that they would get Covid-19, she said.

&gt;Ms. Wong, who hasn‚Äôt been the victim of a crime, said she has talked to the NYPD since March to voice her concern about anti-Asian sentiment and crimes and share concerns she hears from others in the community.

&gt;‚ÄúEveryone thought it was a matter of time before someone said something derogatory or someone hurt them or someone said they should go back to their country,‚Äù she said",0
"Because cars are not mass transportation. They are giant machines that often transport a single person to work, at enormous cost to the environment, noise levels, traffic, collisions with pedestrians and bikers, and our wallets.

"Staten Island is not cheap, except compared to Manhattan or good parts of Brooklyn/Queens. I would say that Staten Island is actually quite overpriced considering how far removed it is from Manhattan and how little culture is there. There are places in Long Island/Westchester/New Jersey with faster commutes to Manhattan and more things to do.

There is actually quite a bit of wooded areas in Staten island, check the map.

There are no attractions in Staten Island (except for the Alice Austen House and the Conference House and Snug Harbor).

The South Shore is very safe, the North Shore is not safe.

The nicest areas of Staten Island are the three hills: Grymes, Todt, Lighthouse. Lighthouse is my favorite hill, Todt Hill has too much mafia (although the Staten Island Academy and the Richmond County Country Club are both in Todt Hill, so objectively it's probably the best neighborhood in Staten Island).

And then there are a few very nice streets in Great Kills (the area between Hylan Blvd and Amboy Rd).",0

This is some bullshit. I'm not the one who alluded to killing a group of jews. The idea that I'm disrespecting the holocaust must be one of those stupid right wing rhetorical tricks people use these days to deflect calling out something that amounts to a soft dog whistle to the holocaust itself.

So, she doesn't exist in the database, even though we know her correct voter id, part of her name and address are now erroneously someone elses, but her birthday is correct. They said it must have been a data entry error. 

The real issue is that no one at the BoE seems to be able to fix it. In fact when we call they think we're confused and that her real name is this spliced together ""data entry error"". Honestly we've spent so long trying to fix this.... does anyone know someone at the BoE who has some authority or competency with their systems?

Are Prices on Grubhub and Seamless higher then direct? Sometimes yes, but they usually add 50c to 1$ per item difference. Depending what you're ordering it shouldn't be that big of a difference. 

Does that price difference include a delivery fee? The further away you're ordering from the larger of a delivery fee you're likely to pay. 

Did you also forget to change the automatic tip? When you put in your payment info and go to checkout Grubhub and all the other services have a nasty habit of filling in the tip area for you presuming you're going to tip. They don't let you save a default tip preference or put it zero. So, did you end up paying a large tip?

I can imagine there being a 10$ price difference if you ordered a handful of things but a 22$ difference? I'd actually call and complain and report that to Grubhub. Though the various services tend to look the other way, the Restaurants are not supposed to charge different amounts.

One thing they do that does piss me off is that they recently added an unavoidable service fee hidden in with the taxes on the receipt. Its 1$ on every order and you cannot remove it or discount it or do anything about it. Door Dash and Uber eats are worse adding 11% manditory fee on everything.

I could see how you want to deploy people to track him as he/people who climb buildings are usually deranged. Also, deploy authority to arrest him on the roof or on the ground. And make sure people on the ground are safe but closing the streets are a stretch.


Let them do their climbing, track them for public safety and arrest them when they eventually come down or up.

This is sometimes referred to as a ""mixed voter."" Someone linked, or incorrectly ""matched"" your fiance's registration to another voters record (or vice versa). It's totally fixable, and I'm baffled as to why no one was able to help you.

Every voter record has an image of each form that prompts a change to the record, as well as a cataloged history of changes. I can't tell from your post if your fiance's record was updated with someone else's form; or if your wife's most recent form was incorrectly added to someone else's record... but it's simply a matter of extracting what's wrong and pairing it with the correct record.

The short (updated) version is that your numerator is positives from new and repeat patients while your denominator is only new patients. That was fine for a long time (few people were tested, so almost every test was a new test anyway). The percentage of tests that were from new patients has steadily ticked down (75% over the summer, 60%ish for early fall, 50% in October) and then fell off a cliff this month to under a third of tests being repeat tests around Thanksgiving (even after I adjust for the higher education tests). If the numerator is measuring a population that's so non-representative of the denominator, then the percentage isn't informative.",1

I wonder how Kung Fu and DVD is doing these days..,1
"&gt; Why is the number increasing if we are all doing exactly what we are suppose to be doing?MA has some the strictest rules in all of the US, why is the number increasing?

Because the chance of getting the virus and getting sick is _probabilistic_ in nature. During the summer there was less of a chance to get it, while now there is a higher chance of getting it. In both cases, the probability of getting it was shifted due to a variety of factors (weather, social distancing, strictness of mask wearing, how much time people spent together inside, etc...). I know you're looking for exact, specific, explainable events that have caused increases, but that isn't exactly how illnesses like this virus spread (obviously there are illnesses like norovirus, salmonella, etc. that are pretty specific, but this is not one of those viruses). 

Whether someone gets it relies on a joint probability of _many_ factors, and enumerating them is kind of pointless. Tell me, why do you think the regular flu has way more cases in the winter than in the summer? I've known people who got the flu in the summer - it's not impossible at all, it's just a matter of probability.",1

We've discussed test delays previously in these threads and one of the things that's been suggested is that the testing companies are pooling samples.

It's possible that she got lumped into a batch of 20 people who were all negative, so she got the quickie all-clear while you got lumped into a batch with a positive, so you get the wait. At this short interval, the difference in your personal risk of being positive isn't really significant (the reported test %positive for tests taken on Sunday has gone from 4% among results reported prior to today up to 4.8% for results reported today), so there's no need for concern.

After the initial 6 weeks (that's 3x as long as the ""2 weeks"" bullshit"" by the way), they should have opened everything, with masks mandatory only in public transit (yes, that's it, because that's the only place you might not be able to avoid prolonged (&gt;15mins), close range (&lt;6'

I can't comment on churches and how they are managing capacity...  but... again, these tents aren't spreading the virus, nor are restaurants. It's not a long-range alien virus.  This is suggested from:

"You'll find multiple towns, including Boston, with multiple providers. As I said, it's a matter of profitability, and some towns are worth building by multiple providers. Boston, for example, has a huge transient population - students are willing to switch and sign new agreements each year. This means more customers for providers, and reduces the build cost. Cities are easier to build, in some respects...a provider can add a drop to an apartment complex and net multiple customers off one cable, whereas building a whole suburb development means multiple drops to multiple buildings.  

As for Boston, Comcast has fully built, RCN has decent but unfinished coverage, and Verizon entered the market just a few years ago so their build is ongoing. Starry is not a POTS or cable provider, so it's not obligated to fully build. It doesn't happen overnight, they had to negotiate the areas in which the build occurred. For all the care Reddit pretends to put into ISPs, the city meeting on the Verizon franchise was attended only by a handful of people. If you want things different, you have to get involved.",1

"**I want to preface this by saying I am not trying to argue against vaccines in general or use of the COVID vaccines, in fact I want to get vaccinated as soon as I can.** That said, I work in the Biomed field, specifically within FDA regulated biomedical development and do have concerns about the timeline of this. I can't claim that I am intimately familiar with the COVID-19 vaccine processes that were set by the FDA, and I do believe that the vaccines are most likely both safe and effective given the data coming out of the studies. However, that isn't the same as saying it wasn't rushed. They absolutely were rushed. Mistakes will be made in any medical drug or device development on a normal timeline under the best conditions, and doing so many thing concurrently compounds the issues that lead to those mistakes. 

I want to reiterate, I am absolutely not saying I believe these vaccines are unsafe or ineffective. But anyone familiar with FDA processes should know that the development of these vaccines occurred on a timeline that is conducive to mistakes occurring. Most likely these mistakes will not impact the results of the studies or the development and subsequent manufacturing of the vaccines in meaningful ways, again the data from the studies is very good at this point, but I can assure you the process for the development of these vaccines will have been far from perfect. It is the nature of beast when working on massive projects that are extremely detail oriented with dozens, if not hundreds of people involved (not including test subjects). Thorough audit and review of the development, clinical trials, and manufacturing will have to be performed to double check everything from start to finish, and the best outcome is that they find any mistakes that were made and are able to determine that they did not have any negative impact on the development and subsequent results in the clinical trial.

Several states, including California and New York, are doing independent reviews of the vaccine approvals, which is something I am strongly in favor of. Understanding what occurred during the development, testing, and manufacturing of these vaccines is extremely important and transparency in this will ultimately benefit everyone.",1

"That‚Äôs fair, some allergy symptoms don‚Äôt overlap (sneezing, itchy eyes). Though I‚Äôm seeing plenty of cases with congestion/runny noses that only coincide with their symptomatic period. I‚Äôm writing in congestion and runny nose under the free-text ‚Äúother symptoms‚Äù box in the state‚Äôs contact tracing system. (I do this under the supervision of a team of MDs who are making the call that yes, these are COVID symptoms.)

I think the issue is the symptom list is long and nonspecific. My official checklist includes fever, difficulty breathing/SOB, chest pain, muscle aches, cough, loss of appetite, loss of taste/smell, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and  ‚Äúother symptoms‚Äù (congestion, runny nose, fatigue, COVID toes, dizziness, etc). All of these symptoms run the range of barely noticeable to severe. The most common symptom among healthier people in our dataset is loss of smell! Couple these symptoms with runaway community spread and it is going to be tough to only test those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath. You‚Äôd probably miss the majority of cases in with that strategy.

I hope we can ramp up testing capacity ASAP!",1

So, while the responsibility for decisions is state and local, they don't have a full menu of options because of the lack of a deal in DC.

To be clear, if the Republicans wanted a deal there already would be one.

It is what it is, and many people hold this attitude in the USA - because we have and (apparently violently demand) the freedom to do so, even at great mortal peril to ourselves. It is the price we pay. Other countries which have been able to control their outbreaks and open up entirely used mandated lockdown methods for a short period of time, and had cultures that value civic and collective responsibility over personal freedom.

"No, if people misuse testing it will increase the turn around time for symptomatic and exposed testing...which makes contact tracing less useful.",1
"New cases are the raw number of positive tests. Case rate is the percentage of tests that were positive. The number of tests vary by date, so the two could move independently, although they usually don't except in extreme cases like we're seeing right now due to the holiday. 

From a practical standpoint, the percent positive is mostly a QC metric. It tells you if you're testing enough. If you're only testing severely symptomatic people, for instance, almost all of your tests will be positive but you'll also be missing a lot of cases (basically what we saw back in April). As you add in mildly symptomatic and contacts of symptomatic people and contacts of the contacts, etc., you start pulling the percent positive down (less risky populations) even as the number of cases keeps increases (you catch the occasional case you would've missed). You want the positive to be below 5% to say that your positive test number is actually representative of what you see in the population and preferably below 3% to say your contact tracing is working well. 

Massachusetts' numbers are also a little weird because of the high number of colleges, which threw every swab they could find at students and staff. Almost half of our tests during the school year came from higher education, which were very negative as a whole (heavily tested and easily quarantined population), so they're split out as a separate line. When colleges stopped testing (like over the holiday), the total population %positive line spiked closer to the non-higher-ed population %positive line, which is always higher (less tested and harder to control population).",1
"If the federal government hadn't been such a shit show this year we could've had a month lockdown in March and crushed this virus.

"I'm not sure the drill press is the complete answer here.

You want a jig or fixture that can hold your piece firmly while you drill, and that might be the same regardless of whether you're using a handheld or a drill press.

It looks like the wood you want to drill is roughly the dimensions of a chunk of 2""x4"".

Imagine a 4"" cube of wood ( like from a 4""x4"" ).  Cut this in half at a 45 degree angle to form two wedges.  Place one wedge below your workpiece. and one above, and secure this.

Then, you drill straight down through the top wedge and your workpiece, stopping once your bit is into the bottom wedge.  A drill press may help a little, but a handheld will work too - and a drill press without a jig will still be painful.  This approach limits the wandering of the bit.

If I did it in my shop,  I'd table or chop saw the wedges, and then clamp them in place with a couple wood clamps or a vice, and have at it with the drill.

Alternatively, and depending on what type of drill bits you have, you may be able to work your way up - drill a small pilot hole ( like 3/16"" or so ), and the keep increasing the size of the bits - they'll want to follow the existing hold rather than wander off.",1

It‚Äôs a wonderful and well known tradition. 

Boston has a lot of history of course but this is one of my favorite parts, despite the tragic origins. 

The tree‚Äôs origins and delivery, as well as its decoration, is well covered in our local news. 

There‚Äôs a wonderful lighting ceremony attended  by local dignitaries.  

Your gift has a place of honor in our city every year. 

Here‚Äôs a write up on last year‚Äôs events:

It's an amazing resource with lots of maps etc.
I think it's white cross and white dots trails I hiked a few years ago. 
Take the steeper one up and easy one down! They kinda parallel each other.
If icy just round trip on the easy one.
Be sure you have access to a map as there are a number of trails which cross/join. 
About 3 hours round trip hike if pretty fit, 4-4-1/2 hours if just a good walker.
As always bring at least 1 good headlamp and waterproof shells/extra layers in case of weather change! 
Not as harsh as the 4,000 footers further north, but still should be respected. I highly recommend the mountain for a next step for moderate hikers.",1

It also irritates most other people who then turn against the larger cause of fighting racism. In short, this is stupid, lazy, and damaging.",1

I maneuvered to get between her and the dog at which point the dog started growling and barking. The owner arrived and started yelling at me to stop scaring her dog, at which point the dog went completely nuts.

On another occasion yet another off leash dog came up to us as we were eating. I asked the owner to call her dog. Her response, he's friendly. I said I don't like dogs (exaggeration). Her response, good luck with that.

Put another way, the measures we currently have in place and anticipate putting in place, plus lost tax revenue, is going to cost $1.35 billion - another pseudo-lockdown would probably cost twice that much. There will be further costs down the road, too, for who knows how many years, so we can't empty the fund. 

That said, there are intermediate steps that could be taken. Ask all nonessential employees who can work from home, to do so. If people exercising outdoors now need face coverings, let's require that for people running on a treadmill or whatever now too. Maybe the state could hire some more people to investigate compliance complaints - I know of at least three businesses that are absolutely flouting the restrictions, that have been reported, but have not been paid a visit by the BOH.

Thus, keeping dogs under control and leashed is important for the preservation of significant bird populations or communities. Similarly, allowing dogs to swim in Fells vernal pools and ponds is harmful to the habitats of a wide range of aquatic species.

Middle school teacher here.  fun fact about kids.  They don't always do what they are supposed to.  Shocking, I know!  And I know you're thinking ""those lousy kids! when I was their age... grumble grumble grumble."" But the fact of the matter is we were little shits when we were kids too and these kids pull their masks off every chance they get, just like we would have.  In my school a large portion of the discipline issues we're having is around keeping masks on.  You currently are asking children and students to take a large risk and basically prove you wrong by getting sick and potentially dying or have lifetime organ damage. The problem is this virus has been politicized and now the right wing that controls the senate won't pass relief and our governor, who is afraid of being primaried from the right, is afraid of putting up more restrictions because somehow it's a republican virtue now to risk the lives of waitstaff and their families and the people who teach them.",1

"I hear you, but the reason why people don‚Äôt give a fuck about cyclists or pedestrians there is because there are so few opportunities to turn left or straight due to the lack of red lights stopping Main Street traffic. So, everyone is glued to the road trying to either find a good opportunity or debating just driving into the oncoming traffic and forcing people to stop and let you go. 

If a driver pauses for a bike or pedestrian, we may lose that opportunity to safely get onto Main Street and then be either forced to wait forever for another opportunity (pissing off everyone behind us) or dangerously drive into traffic. 

As a walker who sometimes strolls through downtown, I avoid that area for this reason. I would suggest trying to find an alternative, even though it‚Äôs tough because there aren‚Äôt many opportunities to get into or out of Medford Square under 93.",1

"In addition to looking for COVID, they look for RNase P. Invalid means that they couldn't detect RNase P, suggesting that either (a) the swab didn't actually pick up cells, (b) the RNA extraction failed or (c) the sample degraded severely in transit. If you don't detect COVID or RNase P, you repeat the test and/or extraction. If you get the same result, you assume there's no RNA and the test was invalid. 

(If you detect COVID but don't detect RNase P, that's still a positive, since you can pick up the virus without picking up cells, especially in an active infection.)

Inconclusive is different. It means that one of the two COVID markers they look for is above threshold, but not the other one. That's not something that should happen biologically, so there's either a false positive or a false negative. Repeat the test with fresh RNA if possible (to eliminate cross contamination). If you can't or the same thing happens, it gets reported as inconclusive.",1

"At first the majority of comments we're pretty much calling me stupid and uninformed without offering any actual advice. The comment I responded to was one of the first ones with actual advice. From the beginning I tried to make it clear that I am aware of how difficult our current plan was. That's the entire reason I posted in the first place. Yes, I consider comments that ignore all of my questions and only offer insults as berating. Of course the thread has evolved but that is what I was specifically talking about. 

And offering more financial info, $1500 is only 40% of our overall income.( I rounded down the hourly wage and round down from our expected income to account for taxes) So i simplify it by estimating $4000 a month which is a little higher than we really expect. Where we just came from rent was closer to 60% of our income. The rest of our bills are ~$800 leaving us with ~43 percent of our overall income remaining. Additionally, her mother and husband have offered to pay our utilities. 

When we looked at advertisements for places in the area, it seemed like there were a good amount for $1500 that seemed doable. Since that is the opposite of what we expected and the opposite of what you guys have told us we were excited to see that but also cautious about hoe realistic it was. As you guys have mentioned, they're more than likely not going to be as good as they seen so we're looking further out. 

P.s. a lot of places are hiring and I'm sure we can easily find something better than our current jobs. We just accepted it because an income while job searching is always better than none.",1

"My username says it all.  I live in Bangkok as a retired expat.
I usually return to Boston yearly for 3 to 4 weeks but Covid-19 has made returning this year impossible as I would not be allowed to re-enter Thailand which has managed to successfully suppress Covid by closing it's borders, amongst other measures.

What currently stands out the most are the huge changes brought about by eliminating the elevated ""South-East Expressway"" and the near disappearance of the middle class and middle class housing.  The rollover of South Boston, Charlestown, Jamaica Plain and Somerville from working class to near million dollar upscale is shocking to me  Even such areas as Roslindale, Hyde Park and W. Roxbury, once the bastion of middle class Boston have become forbiddingly expensive  for any kind of traditional household. 
The impoverishment of low wage service workers who, in the 70s were at least able to sustain basic needs with what they earned is a singular disgrace.  

When I was in grade school, we'd be shown pictures of places like India with homeless people sleeping in the streets, emphasizing to us how lucky we were to live in America where everybody had a home.   How ironic and shameful it is that I see far fewer people sleeping on the sidewalks of Bangkok than I do in Copley Square.

The 70s were as racially divided and confrontational as any in my lifetime.  This was the decade of forced ""Busing"" to integrate schools and the volcanic hatred it engendered was frightening and disheartening.  It put little children in the crosshairs of violence and  was a tragic era of social engineering that Boston has yet to recover from, it's public school system to this day still in tatters. It is beyond my capability to describe how horrible it was.  Instead, please Google ""Theodore Landsmark Photo"" and read the story behind it.  That one photo says it all.",1

The rep said that there's no way Starry was that cheap. I said ""no, I just hate you guys that much.""",1

"Honestly, I like the municipal isp better. While I hate Comcast and the other isp monopolies, and their service is definitely a utility, nationalizing the industry seems dangerous to me, I don‚Äôt trust the federal government to have complete and total access/control over communications and internet service. 

The municipal isp seems like the best of both worlds. Internet service is no longer monopolized by a shitty for profit company, but controlled locally by the people that use it via the municipal isp. However, neither is it solely in the hands of a at times incompetent, detached, corrupt, and even dangerous federal government. While I‚Äôm sure some local governments might abuse it, the scale of what they can do is far far less than what the abuses the federal government could carry out. Even still, if enough municipalities do this, the feds can still have a hand by providing material support and coordination for the municipalities, without the feds actually owning and controlling it.",1

"Agreed.

It's very difficult to meet people in this city unless you went to college here, developed a social network in the school environment, then decided to stick around. 

I personally know several different kinds of people who came here in their 20's as their ""move to a new city"" experiment and ended up leaving within a few years, and the meeting people thing was a big factor in that decision. 

This sub likes to claim just go to meetups etc but the fact is that doesn't work for every type of person, it just doesn't. 

Sometimes it's better to just say ""this isn't working out"" and go somewhere new.",1
I was wondering about this. I'm not American so Thanksgiving isn't a tradition I'll miss but Christmas is going to be lonely as I can't go home so I was thinking of asking if anyone else in the same position wanted a socially distanced park meetup or something.

Optimism: people are being careful because they saw the spike and didn't want to risk the holidays. 

Pessimism: all the asymptomatic people with no known exposure traveling for the holidays filled up all the testing spots, meaning people who should have gotten a test (symptomatic, known exposure) couldn't find a slot.

I'm pretty sure it's usually the other way around - people carrying fake guns that look like real ones.,1
Why are you so wrong about everything,1
"There is some great behavioral science/psychology research on this topic already, in the broader sense.  It is a combination of intermittent reinforcement and a group contingency for reinforcement.  Intermittent reinforcement is when rewards are given randomly (sometimes never) to an individual as long as they have met certain criteria- in this case, taking the vaccine. Group contingencies are when an individual, multiple people or the whole group get a reward based on what an individual, multiple people or the whole group does. In this case, multiple people get the vaccine (maybe not the whole group) and one person gets the reward at random. 

The advantage of intermittent reinforcement is that it ‚Äúkeeps you on your toes‚Äù so to speak. You never know if you will get the reward or not and if so when you will.  The advantage of having it be tied to a group of people is the group gives peer pressure for others to do the behavior because it ups the odds of getting the rewards.

Giving rewards based on the number of people getting vaccinated (so like, a million dollars given to one random person for every million people vaccinated) would be the way to scientifically keep the vaccine momentum up.",1

Because herd immunity protects our most vulnerable who literally can‚Äôt get the vaccine due to illness or allergies.

I understand that we need better leadership to provide messaging from the kinds of professionals who DO know and who are good at breaking things down in a way that laypeople can understand.

I also think we need to just do a better job in general of familiarizing the general public with how these processes work. How a clinical trial works. Who are the people involved. How does a vaccine (or any medication) get manufactured.

I feel like a lot of the skepticism stems from a sort of general dehumanization of the whole ""system"" as if it's robots out there manufacturing academic papers and drugs from thin air.

Cause I have friends at NIH who work on clinical trials. I used to work at a drug manufacturing factory. Both of my parents and my BIL work in chemical manufacturing.

The virus had a foothold and is spreading rapidly, so the ""goalposts shift"" to minimize harm and casualties.  At this point, we need to lower the viral reproductive number.  You seem confused by the changing guidance and that's ok.

"&gt; The biggest single driver of spread these days in Massachusetts is household spread.
&gt; [I can't speak to the specifics of how the virus is spread in Massachusetts, but that statement is not supported by evidence nation-wide.]

There's not a weekly breakout of contact tracing, but comparing the four week average for 10/11-11/7 to the 10/18-11/14 shows an net increase in 5302 contact traced cases, of which 4712 are household spread. The reason likely comes down to how Mass. defines household spread. 

&gt; ""1) A household ‚Äúcluster‚Äù is defined as two or more confirmed Massachusetts cases, who reside at the same address with COVID-19 infection within 28 days of each other, and who are not associated with another cluster

Basically, if two people get sick in the same household and they don't have any idea where they got it, it's household spread. If your kid catches it at the grocery store and spread it around the house, household cluster. If you catch it at work and the executive who coughed in the bathroom before you used it never gets tested, then you give it to someone else in your house, household cluster. 

It's very easy to get household spread and it's very hard to figure out where in the world you initially caught the bug, so household clusters are going to be big numbers. 

&gt; We are launching a public awareness campaign called #getbackmass

&gt; ""It's a reminder that we must continue to fight so we can get back to the things we love to do.""

Oh, I thought the campaign was about distancing. GET BACK, GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DISEASE RIDDLED PEASANTS!

&gt; C: We anticipate that there will be additional capacity that will come online in mid-December.

Seeing that I've been observing social distancing appropriately all along, have gotten a flu shot annually since I was a child, and get sick maybe once a year anyway - typically in late Winter - if I suddenly have a fever, dry cough and other flu-like symptoms, I won't need a test...I already will know I have COVID.",1

I'm really worried for my S/Os dad, who is barely 60 but has some co-morbidities. I'm scared that something bad is going to happen and then my S/O will regret having missed out on spending time with him (even though of course it would be bad if me or my S/O gets exposed, we're young but bad outcomes happen to young people too). Someone on my side of the family already died from covid so no pressure on that end to meet, but it's still really frustrating and scary that this could all just play out again on his side.",1

Frankly, I don't know your circumstances, but I'd use a different group than the one that asked you to use venmo. Check is always fine and credit checks should move quick too.

"Theres a big scene in kendall square and a big scene in burlington/lexington for tech. And of course downtown has a great scene, but thats in different industries that engineers are needed in (healthcare, finance etc).

I did a quick scan of your profile to see if I could get a bit more background on you. 120-150k is pretty optimistic for your first job out of college (but who knows what it will be like in 6 years). It's doable, and your GPA/AP classes seem to indicate you're pretty smart, but it's gonna be 5% of new grad roles where you can expect that pay.

I've never looked at real estate in the area you're describing, but I'd bet its expensive. You could probably afford to live there on 120k/year, but youll be living like someone who makes far less than that.

Compared to NYC/Bay area, expect to make 10-15% less by virtue of being here instead for the same role at the same company. 

Lastly, if your goal is to move to boston after college, maybe look at some more schools in this area since they will have partnerships with local businesses. UMASS Amherst has a great reputation, and UMASS lowell has a great reputation for engineering. On the pricier side you can look at northeastern and WPI. If you have it in you, cant hurt to apply to harvard and MIT. If you want somewhere as a middle ground for cost, the colleges of the fenway have some good schools. If you're female, simmons has a good reputation, and wentworth has a good rep too (but will be hard to hit those high salaries if you go to those schools)",1

I hadn‚Äôt spent much time here before I moved for work so I didn‚Äôt realize how tech centric it is. The Boston/ Cambridge area feels like the San Francisco of the east. Most of the companies there are medium-big in size (mine is about 1,400). I love looking in buildings on the way to the T and seeing the cool biotech and engineering projects on video display that each company is working on. It is very expensive to live here so that sucks but with a 6 figure income you could definitely live quite well. Although expensive it‚Äôs still a bit cheaper than NYC housing. The pay is similar to NYC maybe a little less depending on field although tech it would be on par. It sounds like in terms of lifestyle/ hobbies it could be a fit. I suggest going on to rental sites and seeing what kinds of apartments you could get for your budget. Best of luck!",1

But we don't have that. 

The ratio of students / staff is way out of whack compared to positives of students / staff. So much so that it suggests that current testing protocol is inadequate. 

This gap is why the state is rushing ""rapid tests"" to schools. They know there's a big problem they're not uncovering.

"And oxycontin has been given out without a prescription. But that's by people breaking the law, just like Gosnell did, only he killed actual babies and at least one woman. Doctors acting within the law do not perform abortions that are not medically necessary. There isn't a single state that allows late term abortion without medical cause.

But back to my original point. You made the claim that medically necessary abortions are not a point of dispute, nor are early term abortions. But that's not true. There is a vocal minority of anti-choice activists who are trying to make both those things illegal and are doing a ton of work at the state level to pass personhood amendments and abortion bans based on week of gestation or the cause of the pregnancy (consensual sex vs rape/incest.) These same activists have also been pushing laws making it harder for women to obtain abortions at any time, like TRAP laws, 24-hr waiting periods, mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds, defunding of local health care clinics, superfunding of crisis pregnancy centers which provide no medical at all, and so on. And then there are the highly vocal small number of crazies who picket abortion clinics, harass clinic workers and people seeking reproductive care, and who take even more extreme actions like bomb threats -- and actual bombs. And this is to say nothing of the judicial strategies employed by these people -- mostly Christian nationalists -- to seat religious extremists on appellate courts hoping to overturn precedent at the state and federal level.

You have, in your simple statement, disregarded 4 decades of violent anti-choice activism on two issues you claim are uncontroversial.

To your latest point, whether medically unnecessary late-term abortions should be permitted is actually not a highly controversial subject. There has been no major push from pro-choice advocates to legalize abortion up to birth for reasons other than medical necessity, either for the woman or the fetus. What you're calling disagreement is actually right-wing propaganda. Less than 1% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks -- so this is a tiny number of overall patients. When physicians and gynecologists DO encounter the rare woman who seeks an abortion after 24 weeks *without medical necessity -- a much tinier subset --* those are usually situations where there is domestic violence, the woman is depressed, the woman is on drugs, the woman is suddenly raising kids (or is pregnant) on her own, she tried to get abortion care earlier but because of other restrictions/cost she couldn't, or she is extremely young and had no idea she was pregnant. Those situations are largely handled through better social welfare programs and sex education, not hand-wringing about a non-issue.",1

"The joys of federalism. Good question.

So this is like when segregation was illegal at the federal level but legal at the state level. It's also like the issue we're dealing with today regarding marijuana legalization.

There's a difference between a national abortion ban by constitutional amendment, and a national abortion ban by federal statute.

It's extremely hard to get an amendment to the US constitution. The last one was passed in the 1990s. Let's consider that out of scope for now.

More likely, in a 5-4 or possibly 6-3 decision, SCOTUS in the future overturns Roe v. Wade, removing the ""federal floor"" protecting baseline abortion rights and opening the door to restrictive legislation.

Let's further assume that the Republicans control both houses of Congress and the presidency.

Okay, so in this horrifying dystopia, the GOP Senate and House pass a bill criminalizing abortion. The providers could be subject to criminal prosection, women seeking abortions could be subject to criminal prosecution, their partners or anyone who enables their access to abortion (e.g. a boyfriend who gives them money) could be subject to criminal prosection, and companies that manufacture and distribute medical abortifacent drugs could be subject to criminal prosection. The president then signs that bill into law or 10 days pass with no answer to Congress and the bill automatically becomes law.

At that point, any protection for these groups of people in state constitutions is only relevant insofar as the state can't pass laws criminalizing abortion care. And state funding and access to abortion could still be provided.

BUT! Any person in these states with state-level protection could still be subject to federal prosection. If the Justice Department gets needed funding from Congress to engage in these investigations and prosecutions, and they have an interest in doing so, they could totally prosecute women, men, and individuals at corporations for violating federal law. There could also be financial impact to the states. The federal government could withhold money from state governments for providing any sort of abortion care or access. The federal government could come in and shut down clinics like Planned Parenthood by force. 

Basically, life would suck big time for anyone in the country who's sexually active. The more Christian nationalists the right wing successfully gets into positions of power, the more likely these scenarios are to happen.",1

So sure masks may do a little bit (especially in indoor, health care settings) - but stop pretending like they are going to make any significant difference in the grand scheme of things in terms of cases or deaths. They do NOT have any significant effect, period. Nothing you think will change that. The WHO can recommend whatever desperate measures along with anyone else, but that still doesn't mean that masks make a significant difference.

They confirm you have an appointment.... then they have you scan a QR code, which basically puts you in a Queue to go inside....

"That still isn't likely to make much difference, unless someone is right on the threshold of a rapid test. 

The issue with rapid tests is they're inherently less sensitive than PCR. That means they can easily miss new and/or mild infections. You could, in theory, take a thousand rapid tests on day 1 or 2 or 3 and not pop positive once. The only thing that's going to increase your likelihood of getting a positive on a rapid test is the time it takes for the infection to build.

Rapid tests are meant to be used to confirm suspected infections, not confirm the lack thereof. It's the same story with rapid flu tests. In an ideal world, they wouldn't be used *at all* for people not showing symptoms of a respiratory infection.

"&gt;Are you saying that fomite transmission (contaminated objects) is the mechanism of transmission within households, 

No. People in households socialize (e.g. roommates hanging out, drinking, smoking, etc.). Maskless, too, and funny enough just about all if not all of the CDC studies about ""mask effectiveness"" are all about indoor-specific settings (and often with people who are sick, too).  That's direct, close range exposure to short-range droplets, which is the main way this thing spreads other than touching sick people directly. 


&gt;how do you explain the early choir clusters?

This is the ""special circumstance"" I mentioned in my previous reply. Further research in these settings could not rule out other methods of transmission. 

It's doomer fantasy to assume there is a high risk of spreading the virus this way. They have a handful of ""well documented"" instances of it... out of how many total instances? A billion? How many choirs, restaurant dining sessions, etc. have there been since March? Billions is probably about right.

"&gt;diners are likely contributing to higher rates of transmission because they're probably talking to others at the table (known to increase output of respiratory droplets) and are in low-ventilation, air-exchange &lt; 3x hour indoor rooms for longer than 30 min. at a time. 

The alternative is they talk to the same people in their home. No one is avoiding socializing for 1-2 months, let alone 18, which is where this is headed. 

And while they are ""contributing"" to the spread it does not mean they are a large proportion of it.

&gt;Respiratory droplets are the primary cause of transmission. Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

Respiratory droplets are short-range and highly directional (talking loudly, yelling, coughing, sneezing directly at someone). Even if you looked right at your server when you placed your order and started talking (vs. while looking at the menu, as many people do), you're probably not going to hit him in the face with saliva (they're often above you, your saliva has to work against gravity), and even if you did, you'd have to be perfect-timing the worst time to dine out, which is shortly before you become symptomatic (you think you're fine, but you'll become ill soon)... but that's assuming you are even sick, and Fauci said that ~0.8%? (and many of these people are symptomatic, so this are unrealistic worst case odds of someone being ill when they dine out) of the population is infected at any given point in time. Pretty slim odds here of anything bad happening. You're basically worrying about ""that one guy who had his first COVID-sneeze while out in public."" Going too far for too little here. 

Also, touching sick people directly is bundled with respiratory droplets. That's probably even higher risk, especially intimate touching (read: kissing, household activities w/ family where you touch someone's face, etc.) 


&gt;Previous examples like the choir at the church singing with projecting voices suggests talking loudly is enough of an increased risk for others in the room like restaurant staff.

These are one-off instances. There have been literally countless *possible* instances of transmission like this around the world, yet only a few documented instances of transmission. Also, singing and talking loud is night and day. 

&gt;Eating at a restaurant for dine-in is an optional activity. Ideally, people would takeout and tip generously for staff risking their safety. Although, I agree it would be better PPE practice if K/N95s were provided to staff/high risk grocery workers.

K/N95 masks have been readily available in stores. Some Asian markets have KN95 10-packs for ~$20.",1

As pointed out in another comment, CDC recommendations to see people again are 10 days after symptoms first appeared and 24 hours without a fever without use of fever reducing medications. And that most people do not need to be retested to be around others again.

Your concern is valid as it seems you've followed exactly what the health organizations have both directly told you, and both CDC and WHO recommendations for when to see others, but as many orgs have pointed out, people do test positive well after they're contagious. I so appreciate you following the rules around getting tested before coming here, but more than likely whether you test positive or not, as long as you've been symptom free for two weeks you're among the least likely to be actively spreading covid as you now have antibodies that prevent renfection for a couple months.

When my cousins spent the summer with us my mom would pick them up at the airport and drive them the long way through Boston to our house while pointing out different places.  The 6+ of us would spend our time at the Science Museum and the MFA. We also loved going to the JFK Museum that had kid friendly performances every month that were awesome (puppet shows, storytellers, musicians, book authors).  We would tour the USS Constitution, walk in the Boston Commons and visit the Isabella Gardner Museum.  I did learn a lot of history but as I grew up to show my own friends around I would learn more and it's always fascinating. (I just learned today who Faneuil Hall was named after and that a group is trying to change the name! A few years back I joined a halloween tour and learned a bunch about the dead buried everywhere) 

I also danced in the Boston Ballet growing up.  My mom drove me up to 4 times a week into Boston and I danced at the Wang Theater in many performances. We even had a dance for the opening of the Zakim Bridge which I vividly remember because our ""cars"" crashed at the end of the dance haha.

I remember figuring at one point that hospitalizations would probably need to get into the 700-800 range before deaths were clearly rising above the noise, e.g. getting up around 30+ as a consistent average.

But that was before they dropped a bunch of probable hospitalizations from the data, so fuck if I know where we are relative to that estimate.

Plus infections are trending younger, so IFR is naturally going to be lower anyway.",1

"Mainly what I am upset about, regarding Baker, is the incessant goalpost shifting. At the beginning of the summer, he and the DESE refused to give guidance to schoold districts about re-opening. They told districts in July to make three plans (fully open, hybrid, and remote obly) and to submit those plans. All districts did this, and then very quickly (within days) had to have SChool Committees choose a path for their district. Different SC made different choices. 

Then the DESE came out with a ‚Äúmap‚Äù (what everyone sees now, the color-coded mal by town) for what districts should do. Keep in mind this map was released after districts had made the decision of what to do. Red was fully remote, yellow was hybrid or remote, and green was fully open or hybrid. They said all districts should follow that map and if your school district community went red, shift to remote learning (or vice versa for other colors, etc). About 70% of districts in MA went hybrid or fully remote at this point. 

Then when the numbers started going up, they changed the guidance. Now you had to be red for THREE weeks to go remote. 

Then they changed the guidance again and said that red didn‚Äôt mean you should go remote at all. This was about two weeks ago, as numbers were skyrocketing and communities were jumping into the red left and right. 

Now they threw away that map because it looks bad (120 red communities) and made all those communities yellow. And everyone should be in school, deapite the fact that the highest case rates are in the population of school aged children. Now DESE (and very foolish people online) are saying that students are getting the virus because they aren‚Äôt in school... except most kids ARE in school AND when they weren‚Äôt in school (April through Sept), children numbers were VERY low. 

So to me, its the data manipulation, the lies, the goal post shifting, and the very very bad ‚Äúscience‚Äù they are using.",1
"Oh thank you! So hmm if I'm thinking about this correctly we shouldn't compare current number of cases to April because the number in April should have actually been way higher had everyone had access to tests. But if we compare the rate of 30% in April to now which is only 3% positive out of all tests.. we're still much better off than April, right? ü§îü•¥",1

&amp;#x200B;

But if the initial vet visit sees ANYTHING remotely close to a symptom, insurance won't cover it, forever, as pre-existing.  And unless they pay to cover something, you don't get any value for the premiums.  It really only helps in truly catastrophic situations where, I'll be brutally honest, you may not want to put your pet through it anyway.

"The 1584 is the 7 day average of based on when the tests were reported. The ""New Cases Per Day"" graph is a 7 day average based on when the tests were taken. There's going to be a small offset there.

There's also the issue where it'll take a little while for the tests taken to be reported, so you'll typically cut off the last few days in making the charts that rely on ""swab taken"" dates. The last seven actual days are 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604, 1205, 377 and 4. You can see that's pretty useless for a seven day average, since you've got a couple days that are just too soon for tests to be returned. Even that 1205 will probably jump a bit.

So, instead, you cut off the last three or so days and end up with 1133, 871, 518 followed by the same 1806, 1720, 1745, 1604 for the ~1400 average on the graph. Since our trajectory is upward and there were a couple of weird days around Halloween where we dropped below 1k, every day we'll see more cases reported, but we'll have to wait a bit for the ""new cases per day"" graph to catch up. 

Also, expect a big jump in a few days in that line when those two Halloween days drop out and the 1205, 377 and 4 get filled in with reported tests. It's one of those things that will be dramatic looking, but it's the same old scary trend catching up in the graphs rather than a new scary trend.",1

Moral righteousness isn't magic. Masking and the fact that the protests occurred outdoors during the summer may have helped, but changes in behavior of non-protestors (staying home) probably also contributed.

I don't know about middle and high school students, but I am looking at the elementary school kids (neighbors and friends) - they all go to extra curricular activities. Some even get sent to a ""daycare"" for their remote hybrid days, as both parents have to work. If we assume that there's a  risk of transmission anywhere, wouldn't it be better for kids to just go to school and nowhere else? At least spread would be somewhat localized, versus it getting spread all over the place? 

So by keeping schools hybrid we are effectively trading kids going to the same place every day with the same group of peoe for kids going to different places every day with different people. I understand the teachers position fully, especially ones who are in a risk group, but I honestly don't know whether keeping schools hybrid vs in person would make that huge of a difference from perspective of virus spread in the larger community.",1

Do you take their temperature as they enter the building, make sure the sit in their seat the entire day and not get within 6ft of another human? Do you watch them while they eat and make sure to document anyone who coughs or sneezes? Because THAT is what being in school looks like.  There is so much time devoted to staying safe- that any time on learning is FAR less than what they would receive virtually on a screen- where they can clearly see the teachers‚Äô face, and their friends faces.

"&gt; this is 3 days worth of October data that just happened to get released today so

The data that is added in today from that October delay is actually relatively modest. As I mentioned above, we can subtract yesterday's daily totals from today's daily totals to see where new cases were posted. It's at most 181 cases (the total number of October cases added), but it's probably less than 100. There's 73 that look like outliers because they're about a week old and should've been reported before this. After that, there's 89 on Halloween that look like the normal reporting delay and the other 1857 were all reported starting November 1st, which would be outside the scope of the footnote. The wording of the footnote is a little tricky: 

&gt; Today‚Äôs 2,038 new cases include 3 days of delayed data from tests performed in October by a national laboratory. Today, this lab reported almost 300 cases, and on average reports fewer than 50.

They're reporting 3 days of delayed tests from October and they're reporting almost 300 cases rather than the normal 50, but it doesn't say that the excess cases are actually from October. Since we have the new and old raw data, we can see that they weren't.

&gt; Not actually over 2000 daily cases. Still around 1200

You mention below that you're referring to page 6, but that number is still being backfilled. The tests taken this week haven't been fully reported back. It's pretty common for it to take a few days for the data to stabilize, which is why most of the charts that cover percentages either crop out the last couple of days or refer to the ""Due to lag in reporting by laboratories, counts for most recent dates are likely to be incomplete"" footnote. 

Today's report added 362 cases on Monday (to bring it to 1684), 295 on Tuesday (1330), 816 on Wednesday (1187) and 282 on Thursday (282). We won't know how high they will actually end up for a little while. If we assume the same basic delay and backfill rate, you could be looking at a week of 1600-1700ish numbers. It'd be nice if it did stay lower, but there's no evidence to support that.

It's definitely true that the numbers shown here and at the top of the thread tend to be shifted around a little. Monday/Tuesday tends to be a little lighter and Thursday/Friday tends to be a little big heavier because of when tests are taken and when they're reported, but that's (a) a reason to mostly focus on the 7 day averages and (b) still a valid way of discussing tests as long as you're consistent about what number you're looking at. 

Reported date is convenient because, as I showed above, it's a lot easier to see what the number is today rather than trying to figure out exactly what happened to test totals across an entire worksheet. Tests aren't being double counted, so if we have one outlier day, it'll be pretty obvious pretty quickly and it'll smooth itself out (like it did when they upgraded the dashboard on the 24th and dumped two days of results on us). We're also all sort-of used to the normal weekly variation, so it's not something that drives conversation too much.",1

"I am not familiar with any well-grounded form of public policy, health or otherwise, that considers pragmatism to be anything other than achieving the greatest tangible effect at the smallest degree of intervention.

We have very high mask adherence in MA. We will never reach 100% nor reach 0% human error. We don't disagree about that. We also seem to agree that the vast majority of transitory outdoor situations, mask or no mask, are of virtually zero epidemiological relevance.

This precondition sets the stage for the newly expanded mask mandate to be - *at best* - a vanishing degree of marginal benefit in pursuit of Nth-degree micro-management.

Your justification that it will lead to a little improvement at the margins bakes in several assumptions: that the relatively obscure hypothetical you're plucking from one end of the behavioral distribution long tail occurs at any type of frequency that impacts transmission; that the behavioral outliers on the other side that you're failing to at all consider won't become stronger negative contributors to pandemic control (e.g. the person who normally complies with indoor mask usage now goes ""fuck all of it""); that the expansion of this mandate bears no pandemic-related deadweight cost unrelated to the mask vs. no mask question (e.g. population burnout/tiredness at being micromanaged diminishes adherence to other guidance; newfound ubiquity of masks leads to cavalier attitudes about other, more important practices like sustained distancing); and that the expansion of this mandate bears no broader deadweight cost (e.g. bad enforcement actors abuse this newfound power; health-incentivizing behavior like outdoor exercise becomes disincentivized).

None of the things I listed are about ""it won't achieve perfection so it's bad"". All of them are about ""we need to think broadly about marginal returns and unintended consequences to be sure we're acting sensibly"".

this is the ballot question in Florida. MA voted on similar lines for a minimum wage increase, only we will reach ours faster because we voted on it in 2018. 

&gt; Last election they voted to give felons voting rights (again something 90% of the privileged Boston eggheads would cringe at)

two flaws here: the NYT has white college graduates at 49 - 49, and acknowledge that they do not account nearly enough for mail in ballots, who were more likely to be that demographic. white college graduates voting for Biden especially increased *in* key swing states, primarily MI, MN, and PA. moreover ""all of Boston"" clearly doesn't line up with your statement, given that Boston, Cambridge, and MA more widely all heavily vote Democrat. if the demographic of specifically Boston voters, and more broadly college educated white voters, was overwhelmingly Trump, why would the state with the highest proportion of those voters vote overwhelmingly Dem?

"That's a lot of questions, and I'd highly recommend checking out some of the sidebar info, old threads where people ask about living here, and googling.

That being said, from my perspective as a mid-20s professional, I think Boston checks most of your boxes. I have time, so here's some info:

* There is a lot to do. I hike quite a bit, am on a local sports team, and during non-covid times visit museums a lot and have a yearly subscription to Boston in Broadway shows. There's a solid music scene, lots of breweries, good food, and good shopping.
* The economy is solid. I work in software, and my mid 20s friends have all settled in well to the city in white-collar jobs. I have less knowledge on the blue-collar side of the economy, but the Boston area has always had a large population of blue collar workers.
* Boston is pretty expensive. If you want a bit of land and some more space, you'll likely not be able to rent in the downtown area. There are a lot of nice areas within 30 minutes of the city though if you're willing to be a bit further out. I'd explore zillow to get the best idea of what you can get with your money.
* Yeah, the age is pretty mixed. Lots of college kids, tons of mid-20s professionals, and a good number of older people still living in the city. There is quite a bit of diversity, but Boston is a more historically segregated city, so you'll find neighborhoods that are mostly white or mostly hispanic/portugese etc. rather than the whole city being a huge mixing pot of people. There are a lot of churches because this is an old city, but the population itself isn't particularly religious.
* The city is pretty dog friendly. You see lots of people in downtown with dogs, and there wouldn't be an issue bringing a service dog into stores or restaurants. If the service dog is certified, you shoudn't have issues with housing. A good friend of mine has a 24/7 service dog who is always downtown with them.
* Boston is a somewhat smaller and historical city, so the atmosphere is quite different than Chicago or LA. There's a distinct financial district, historic Italian neighborhood (North End) and many distinct parts of the city. It's nice to have a car for day trips out of the city and convenience, but it's a very walking-friendly city. My SO has a car, but in my 7 years here I never personally have.
* The winter is kind of grey and sucks a little, but imho it's worth it for the rest of the year here. And there's easy access to skiing/snowboarding if you're interested.",1

I think you put the cops in pairs, so people are less likely to get aggressive with them. Put one pair per subway line - that's 10 cops if you count silver line, and then divide the bus routes into 5 approximal even zones. Have the cops constantly riding, changing trains or buses at every stop, 7 days a week. At that rate, you're fairly likely to bump into a cop at least once a month.",1

"no, I'm pointing out that I think all Democratic leaning states (whether they have the outward image of being very left, like CA, or ""fake liberal,"" like MA, among progressive voters) are *much* less overall progressive than we originally thought. 

each state has some things that are more liberal than others. that's not ""ignoring our own flaws,"" it's being realistic about what a ""real vs. fake"" progressive state looks like. MA has much stricter gun laws when compared to Vermont, which still maintains constitutional carry (you don't need a permit to carry a gun, open or concealed). California had much more difficulty legalizing gay marriage than VT or MA, but now has much stronger protections regarding civil and human for transgender individuals than either state, including being the first and only state to ban trans and gay ""panic defenses."" 

MA in some instances looks more progressive than it actually is (weed laws). in some instances, CA looks more progressive than it actually is (ballot questions, as mentioned above). in some cases, VT looks more progressive than it actually is (gun laws). liberal and progressive platforms are nuanced and cover a lot of different aspects and areas of law, and I think we should be more careful in our assessment of the political leanings of states we perceive as more liberal than ours because of it. 

moreover, I never stated that Massachusetts had no flaws, only that the ballot questions were relevant in addressing flaws in MA. you haven't listed any specific policy from Vermont or California that you would like to see enacted here aside from the accessibility of legal weed, and I agree that it should be more easily available. what else would you like to see? is it possible that in some ways, California is a more liberal state, and in others, Massachusetts is?",1

I managed to climb over him (since he wouldn't move for me) to sit a little farther away, but the bus was packed. Shortly after, he started singing on the bus....still unmasked ! 

In october, a man holding a bottle of liquor got on the bus without a mask and was coughing shamelessly, not even trying to cover his mouth. I could hear the phlegm come out of his mouth. I got off the bus as soon as i could, right as he was getting in another passenger's face for commenting on his behavior. 

I do not feel safe on the bus at all and if i were to catch covid, it would definitely be from these dangerous passengers",1

It's also important to note that pandemics don't stop at state borders. We can do all we want, but as long as the country does badly, we will still be very much affected.

"Calling it ""Kendi-esque"" is ignoring that Kendi is only stating what educational research has established for decades. It's not unique to him. I'm also a huge critic of his book and supporter of not reading it so trying to find some way to lump us together makes no sense. You're aiming for something that isn't there.

Higher ed. isn't left-thinking. It's (neo)liberal. Don't conflate the two. Higher education wants everything at the same time and has no means of getting it. The people who work in the field, especially at the collegiate level, are absolutely obnoxious and stand for nothing. They're so used to playing victim that they don't know how to take a stance in materialism (e.g. get results, keep them, and say that maybe this is our reality). You don't need to explain that to me and if you need a third person to tell someone else so that's basically why I have this account.

Kendi's claim about racism is like what, 1/12 of what we need to have this discussion? The real issue is about how income correlates with success anyway. But these highlights can be cross-referenced where we can see how Black people systematically make less and are denied opportunities. That's the whole issue.

"I wanted to have my dates correct when I composed that post so naturally I went to Wiki and was surprised how little information was there...mostly just cross-references to successor agencies.  
My personal knowledge relies on a ageing brain, an often unreliable and anecdotal date-base.  I grew up in the Reading, Melrose, Malden area so the MDC was always in the background of our lives then, controlling the many parkways and wooded reservations in that vicinity.
It's difficult to understate the all encompassing influence the MDC had on the eastern half of the state, post WW2.
They controlled the entirety of the water supply network and all public lands.   Most of the major roadways leading into Boston were controlled by the MDC as well.  Because it's leadership positions were all appointed with no term limit, it was not in any way accountable to the electorate.  
It's important to understand that in the era up to the 80s, the Massachusetts Governor was  very weak.  He was answerable to the ""Governor's Council"" a holdover from Colonial days and the President of the Senate actually had more practical power. It was notable that during the 80s and 90s, that senate president was non-other than William ""Billy"" Bulger, younger brother of the infamous gangster and serial murderer James ""Whitey"" Bulger. He went on to become president of U-Mass/Boston.

I would suggest you start your research into the MDC by focusing on the planning and development of the Quabbin Reservoir which was probably the MDCs signature project.  From that research, a lot of ancillary information should become apparent.

"I agree with you here, and I also think there is some moral conflation happening in this thread more broadly. There are two separate issues that are being seen as one --teenage drinking and teenage drinking during COVID. Should anyone be hanging out in big groups drinking beer right now during a global pandemic? I hope we can all agree that for public health, the answer to that question is no. And holy hell, do I miss drinking with friends.

That said, America has a higher legal drinking age, by several years, than other similarly-developed countries. I am not sure if I'm shocked about the sentiment around teenage drinking tending to be a little more conservative (some might use the term ""puritanical,"" however incorrectly), but I also recognize that this condemnation seems to be an American thing. Teens drinking? Let me clutch my pearls. This might not be as big of a deal in a place like Europe.

(Again, I agree that nobody should be should be hanging out in a group drinking beer in someone's basement during a pandemic. Separate issue.)

I also don't have teenagers, don't ever want to, and therefore have no stake in the claim of whether I would want ""my kids"" drinking at someone's house. I don't want kids, period. But maybe, just maybe, if we didn't make such a huge deal about alcohol, the mystique would be a little less influential on teens looking to have a good time. But then again, I don't know.",1

I had a hard time making friends here pre-pandemic, and now everyone is just hanging out with people inside of their ""bubble"". I'm lonely and bored most of the time but here are some things I tried to do to stay entertained since March that would also work during the winter:

* Watched live-streamed concerts of my favorite artists (even better when it's FB/IG live since it has a more interactive feel)
* Hopped on the baking band-wagon (it's time-consuming and delicious)
* Re-connected with friends who don't live in Boston (we set up a recurring day/time to hang-out which has helped us stay in touch more easily than one-off chats)
* Went back to the gym a few times for socially-distanced workout classes
* Ordered take-out from restaurants I haven't tried before (Boston isn't as much as a ""foodie"" city as some other places I've been but there are some good restaurants if you really look!)

And some things I want to try:

* Attend virtual meet-ups in other cities. We're not limited to Boston anymore so who knows what interesting people you might meet! 
* Winter hiking (I'll probably hate it but New-Englanders really love their winter activities so I'm willing to try it)",1

"A lot of the over-regulation can be traced back to the conflicting array of land management bureaucracies that existed in Massachusetts in the 20th Century; specifically the MDC (Metropolitan District Commission) which was established in the 1890's to oversee Massachusetts state parklands and public resources.  Without going into a lot of historic detail, suffice to say it became a huge bureaucracy and patronage dump that far outstripped it's original mandate.  It even maintained it's own armed police force that competed with the Mass. State Police on many levels.  For many years they were politically untouchable and did and regulated however they wanted with no electoral accountability.   It was finally broken-up in the mid-80s. The Massachusetts Water Resources Auth. (MWRA) and Dept. of Conservation &amp; Recreation (DCR) were established to take over resource management.  The MDC police were absorbed (kicking &amp; screaming) into the State Police.  Most retired immediately as less than 20% of them were able to pass the State Police physical.",1

"I can. I don't believe in public exam schools. They're a disgusting model that saps the city of its resources by making it seem like they're doing right by students. They aren't. Scrap exam schools all together and return schools to their communities for starters. The idea of ""competitive schools"" doesn't make sense. Education isn't a net zero gain.

&gt;Keeping in mind that these schools graduate students who frequently go on to academically demanding colleges.

Right now there's no free college, especially these ones even if they offer financial aid. There's no reason we should feel obligated to send students to college. The only reason that's happened is because other options have been taken away and sent abroad.

We also don't then see the benefits of their education while they drown in debt. The best researchers end up working for private companies. I don't know a single Ph. D working for the government. That's a far cry from decades and decades ago where the government was at the helm of research and basically still is with funding (like how pharmaceutical companies do only a tiny bit of research at the end for their drugs).

The very idea that we're feeding kids into the college system is what makes college even worse. If colleges want the integrity then they should be educating students well enough on their own. It's not our prerogative to make sure kids are ready for an ultimately privatized system.

&gt;It's ""wont to do.""

It's autocorrect. Don't grasp too hard.

&gt;What if the opinion is that this person hasn't shown either the preparation or aptitude necessary to handle Calculus II? Is that racist?

Nope! Someone's either ready or not. But we can also look at scores in the aggregate and see who's ready or not and it does reveal fault lines along demographic lines.

And again, I would say side note: don't even bother with Calculus in high school anyway. People only ever use Algebra and Geometry in their life and never use calculus. Nationalize colleges and teach it there, or in a sort of gymnasium-style system like in Germany.

That was my realization a few days ago as I was cleaning up the code for the graph. My exact comment was something along the lines of wanting policies reacting to the presence or absence of covid rather than the presence or absence of students.

Honestly, I want to take care of this now because there are some really bad numbers out there, especially in places where you see fewer college students pulling it down. Lawrence had 380 cases last week on 5283 tests.  

It's great that Amherst, Cambridge and Wellesley had sub-0.2% positive rates while having more than one test per five official residents, but Lawrence had a 7.2% positive rate and one test for every ~17 people, so hopefully this week's report will result in flooding it (and all the higher percent areas) with tests.

Welcome to Boston!  Despite the comments and the downvote on your post, of course there are bookstores in Boston that buy books!

Two stores that I've sold some books at:

* Brookline Booksmith (in Brookline)
* Raven Used Books (Harvard Square)

10-20% of the original price of books doesn't sound like a lot, but if you have tons of books that you wanted to sell, it adds up! :)",1

"Unless you mean multi member districts there isn‚Äôt a redistricting  solution.

As it goes now outside of Boston you get a combination of regions not big enough for a full congressional district and the bigger one wins. Like the 2nd district is Greater Worcester, the eastern Pioneer Valley and parts of Suburban Boston. Greater Worcester is the largest individual faction so that‚Äôs where the Rep is from. In MA-01 Springfield is larger than the Berkshires/Pioneer Valley so their guy wins. 

In MA-06 it‚Äôs the urban North Shore beats out the Merrimack Valley/Suburban North Shore areas. So Moulton/Tierney are from the southern tip of the district. 

MA-03 Lowell beats out metrowest and Lawrence. Each of the top 3 finishers represented a region of the district. 

MA-04 went the way it went because of the South Coast beat the metrowest areas. 

There are just obvious areas of the state that FPTP obviously benifits.

And considering which parts of the state tend to get somewhat disenfranchised (geographically dispersed suburbs) and which disproportionately benifit (Working class gateway cities) I could see the outcomes looking pretty much like Markey/Kennedy

People who oppose you aren‚Äôt just dumb. They want the system that helps them. Duh. And for Lowell or Springfield keeping the current system preserves their political clout.

"&gt; Unless you mean multi member districts there isn‚Äôt a redistricting solution.

There are a variety of ways to fix it, multi-member districts works. I was thinking more along the lines of defining entirely new districts around [communities of interest](https://ballotpedia.org/Community_of_interest), but there are many solutions where redistricting _does_ in fact help people get better representation. I am sure we both agree that what we are trying to maximize here is how representative the elected officials are of the electorate.

Almost every example you gave is further proof that the elected officials aren't really representative of the communities they are supposedly serving, which is just not the point of democracy. I want to vote for someone that will represent my interests and understands my community. Choosing RCV will allow me to do that in a way that doesn't have me casting a vote for a Dem in every single election where I would be better represented by someone else.

&gt; People who oppose you aren‚Äôt just dumb. They want the system that helps them.

And short sighted thinking has, since the beginning of time, never helped anyone in the long run. Saying ""yes"" to RCV will enable more third parties (or new ideas) to get their way into the race (either by thought share, or by actually beating candidates that aren't very competitive). In the long run, this will produce more representative congressman in both local and state-level offices. This should be the ultimate goal of the system, not a minority that due to gerrymandering has caused people to stay in office far longer than they should have.",1

"At least in my case, it's not about snow. It's that, as a driving enthusiast I want the highest performance tires on my car I can get. The trade off for having these sticky, maximum traction summer tires, is that they can't be used in cold temperatures, they will actually be damaged, as well as performing poorly. So, I have a second set of wheels I keep my winter high performance tires mounted on. This makes it a matter of about a half hour to unmount my summer tires and mount my winter ones. 

My winter tires are not snow tires, they're high performance tires optimised for great traction on cold pavement. They do perform better in snow than an all season tire, but that's not why I use them. I use them to give me good traction and handling on cold winter roads. ( also, my winter tires are 18"" to deal with pot holes better, something my low profile 20"" summer wheels would do poorly at ).

Given that every mile I drive on my winter tires is a mile I don't drive on my ( expensive ) summer tires, the cost difference of having summer &amp; winter tires vs using all season isn't that great... Mostly the cost of having an extra set of rims.

Some people DO use winter tires to maximise grip in snow, and there is a huge difference between good snow tires like Nokian or Blizzak vs all season tires, but in my case it's more about performance driving... If I lived in Buffalo, I'd run snow tires during the winter, but here in the Boston area we don't get that much snow, so I'd rather optimise for traction and handling on cold dry pavement. 

If you have to ask, you already know that you're okay with all season tires! :-)",1

We're a couple days from town specific weekly data, but JHU's data is broken out by county daily. (It's included in the PDFs, but only started in the raw data archive in August, so I stayed with JHU's figures.)

These are the [most relevant counties, 7 day rolling average, cases per 100k](https://i.imgur.com/B0FZWA4.png). Essex is definitely high, but we know a lot of that is [Lawrence](https://www.cityoflawrence.com/796/Lawrence-COVID-19-Case-Count) since we're looking at 60-100 daily cases from there right now and ~120 total from Essex.

We'll have to see where in Suffolk the spike is coming from, but the spike in Bristol (with a lesser spike in Middlesex and an Essex spike that's due to a more distant Lawrence) makes me wonder if it is concentrated further south. 

That adds another thing to look at in the weekly, though. I've been playing around with choropleths of Massachusetts.

Keep in mind that RCV doesn't have a significant impact on general election , R vs D races. It is most impactful in party primaries, where there are often many candidates.

Primary elections have consistently low turnout, especially in midterms. High turnout among a community like Puerto Ricans in MA01 can still propel a candidate to a primary victory.",1

"A better idea would the the 18 year term limits for justices on a rotating ""retirement"" schedule.  Gives every president an appointment or two.  When a justice retires from SCOTUS, they get moved back down to the lower courts to finish their lifetime appointments as Senior Justices.

From there, they have a few options:

1. They can work as a true senior justice - basically backfill as a part timer.  They take cases where someone recuses, retires, gets appointed elsewhere, etc. until they decide to fully retire.
2. They resume work as a full time justice.  If there aren't any seats open on the court, you automatically open one for them.  When they full retire from the court, that seat is then open for appointment as normal.  This keeps what are supposed to be our top legal scholars in the system as long as possible, then expands the court in a non-partisan way which has been begged for by the judicial branch for at least a decade now.

In either option above, the ""retired"" SCOTUS justice can also return to SCOTUS to fill in when there is a recusal or other imposition that prevents a sitting justice from hearing a case (illness, retirement, death, or other circumstance that leaves a vacancy).  9 justices at all times, no panic buttons need to be pressed on filling that seat.  If it's a long term vacancy, you just leave that justice in the seat until the next appointment comes up in a few years tops.

"I was describing worst-case scenarios there. Antipsychotic medications don‚Äôt always produce severe side effects in all people; everyone‚Äôs response is unique. The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find a medication (or, more often, a combination of medications) that has the best ratio of benefit to cost. For some people with psychotic disorders, there‚Äôs a medication combo that significantly reduces symptoms without producing severe side effects. Others aren‚Äôt so lucky, and living with severe side effects is the cost of living a life that‚Äôs free from debilitating psychotic episodes. 

There‚Äôs a very common pattern of people starting and stopping their meds, which leads to relapse. I‚Äôm sure you can imagine why someone who has had no psychotic symptoms for a year but who lives with bothersome side effects might believe that they can give it a go off the meds. Sometimes that works for a period of time, but usually the symptoms come back. This, to some people, might look like ‚Äúnot wanting help,‚Äù but viewing the situation through a more compassionate lens helps us understand why someone might make such a decision.

As far as seeing everyone as an enemy, yes, that really makes it difficult to get help. That‚Äôs why our streets are filled with people who have untreated psychotic disorders. Ideally, we can intervene early and help a person get stabilized on meds before their first psychotic break gets too severe. In that case, therapy and family support can help them build insight into the nature of their illness, so that if/when they do experience psychotic symptoms again, they reach out for help before the paranoia becomes crippling. There are plenty of people like that who live satisfying lives. Hell, some of them are even physicians. But there are more who lead very, very difficult lives, and we need to do more as a society to help them.",1

"He's reviewing evidence, most of which is pre-COVID AFAIK and not tainted with political bullshit.

"I like the design but I feel like there are oversights;

- the white plastic is not color matched. 
- support polls should not be painted; it‚Äôs not hygienic and is prone to chipping. 
- the exterior drains over the color making them appear dirty quickly.  
- the doors should shut faster. 
- plastic seats are better than cloth nastiness but they should be more comfortable and retraction should work better. 
- stops and starts are jerky and the vibration and noise is more intense than the old trains. It‚Äôs probably a lighter an more powerful train but they could have designed to match the old performance. 

The concerns are more atheistic but elude to an inferior product. 

For a backdoor to come to light we probably would already be on rocky terms with the Chinese. 

My concerns are:

1. A backdoor causing a denial of service and hindering evacuation or alt something less extreme. This is a worry regardless of origin but tensions with China and gov involvement make it relevant. 

2. I assume they were the low bidder by a decent margin. I‚Äôve looked at high end windows - Chinese were 15k, polish were 30k, and American were 45k.  I also understand their are specs/requirements. While Chinese products can be great, it seems like more often corners are cut. A great train is more than just weight and power. It‚Äôs ride noise, ride vibrations, ambiance, drainage. It‚Äôs intelligent design coupled with quality metals, plastics, glues, breaks, suspension, motors, motor controllers, electronics, software, glass, paint, etc. Anticipating and preventing issues is a huge and expensive process. The mbta might have specs but if they‚Äôre not asking the right questions, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

"Other health experts would say this:

Here‚Äôs the actual story:

Before COVID-19, according to the evidence, people with symptoms and people who work closely with them (e.g. doctors, nurses) should wear masks. If you aren‚Äôt in those categories, wearing a mask is useless-to-slightly-bad. Interestingly this is more or less what many Asian countries have been doing since SARS-1.

If you recall, in the early days of COVID-19, that‚Äôs what the WHO, CDC, Fauci, etc told us to do, based on the reasonable assumption that COVID-19 would be similar to other respiratory viruses. Some countries, however, told everyone to wear masks.

Then scientists started observing that countries with strong masking cultures/mandates were doing much better than countries without. It was very striking. At the same time, evidence was emerging that COVID-19 transmission happens a lot _before_ symptoms. This is around when the mask messaging rightly became very much pro-mask, regardless of symptoms.

COVID-19‚Äôs high presymptomatic transmission is actually somewhat unusual for respiratory viruses, which explains why masking works more for COVID, but it‚Äôs also not some crazy weird hard-to-believe mask-specific mutation.",1

Yikes.,1
"I think it has a lot to do with:

1. Masks. There is less virus being transmitted. If I have it, less virus gets through the mask. If you have a mask on, even less makes it through. So you start the infection with a decreased viral load. 

2. Treatments have improved, doctors, nurses, etc. have better learned how to treat the virus 

3. Younger people don‚Äôt care and are mostly the ones getting sick 

4. It‚Äôs killed off a lot of the most vulnerable already

But death rates are absolutely down. At the peak of the summer spike there were 70k new cases a day, deaths only peaked at 1450 nation wide. This is opposed to the 40k peak of new cases and 3000 peak of new deaths during the spring surge. Almost twice as many new cases resulted in half as many deaths. That is absolutely significant.",1

If we tried to institute a winter lockdown nobody would follow it and it would cause a lot of other problems, cabin fever being the least of them.

What the 2 month ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù did was get us off of that drastic curve that we were at back in spring. What‚Äôs scary is that it‚Äôs not unreasonable to look at the charts from today and see how easily we can be right back to where we were at the height of the curve in a month.

Fortunately deaths are still low and hospitalizations aren‚Äôt close to the overwhelming amount they were back in April and May but my understanding is that those numbers don‚Äôt tend to increase until a week or two after a positive test so this week will be key in looking at those stats.

Like I said, there‚Äôs no real answer and no matter what decision gets made or doesn‚Äôt get made people are going to be pissed and want something else.

Students also don't ""ruin"" a school. Policy does. Phrasing it like ""issues common to the lower class"" makes it sound like you wrote this in men's flats and a powdered wig.

&gt;If Boston was willing to take the lower 20% and stick them in special schools that can handle the issues common to the lower class, the other 80% of students would at least have Quincy-quality schools.

You mean if Bostonians were able to fund a host more of schools and programs instead of shutting them down, sure, but that would require hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars over a short term; something we should have spent already but haven't and which likely can't be resold to an uncaring public.

"All of this is speculation. I think 1 may make some difference, though so hard to really know. 2 may be somewhat true but not nearly enough to explain the magnitude of the mortality difference. (Essentially all the treatments we have make a small difference, if that. Just recently saw an RTC showing remdesivir has no effect and that‚Äôs the only FDA approved treatment. Steroids probably help some but again, not enough to explain such a massive decrease in mortality.) As for 3, the studies actually show mortality down across all age groups so don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs playing a role. 4 could play a huge role, but I think that would be more likely there is some as yet undiscovered genetic predisposition to severe COVID, rather than who we typically think of as vulnerable, as again, these people with typical risk factors (is age, diabetes, obesity, etc) are doing significantly better than previously.

I think such a huge magnitude of difference suggests a change in either virus or host factors, and I think we just don‚Äôt know yet, and maybe never will. I do know we have a tendency to attribute all change to human action, whereas I think much of the dynamics of this virus may be out of our control.",1

"No? There's only one thing that went wrong: someone accidentally made an elevator do weird shit, and after it did weird shit, *she kept messing with it.* She wasn't ""carrying"" a package, she was trying to cram a huge package into the elevator.

She stuffed an oversize package into the elevator, it tripped the door interlock switch, the elevator moved but stopped (presumably the package shifted as the elevator went down) and then she messed with the package a bunch more, causing the sensor to trip again, and the elevator to move again. The description isn't super specific, but I'm guessing she was trying to pull or push on the package, and when the elevator suddenly resumed going down, taking the package with it, she fell in through the open door...or she was hanging onto the package, the package was pulled out of the elevator, and then she was yoinked into the shaft.

Most sane people, when an elevator does something unexpected and end up in a decidedly non-normal state, go ""oh shit, well this is above my pay grade, time to call someone.""

There's a well known security hacker who does exploits involving elevators and he always starts his talk with a safety speech, and the tldr is: **elevators operating in normal mode are incredibly safe for anyone in the cab. If anything goes wrong in an elevator, stay the fuck where you are, and call for help.**

 He continues on to say that there are lots of injuries and deaths involving elevators, but none of them involve people who were fully in the elevator cab, doors closed. The injuries and deaths almost always involve people outside (ie on top of) the cab, or forcing doors open, or trying to get in or out of an elevator that is clearly malfunctioning (like the doors not fully open/closed or the elevator not fully arrived at the correct level.) Basically: people inadvertently trip interlocks in the process of getting in/out, or the interlocks were failing and intermittent...the elevator moves, and the person gets squished.",1

They want to be the person to hand them back to the owner so they get the ""thank you"" that makes them look and feel good. Otherwise they could have easily made a Reddit post with the picture of the keys saying that they are now at the Brookline police station, or were placed back where he/she found them. There are plenty of other ways that this could have been handled that would have given the lost keys more visibility and exposure, but given OP's vehement defense of his/her post along with the hostile and sarcastic responses to others' suggestions, I can't see any other plausible reason.

The reddit grandstanding looks and feels good, but chances are whoever lost them isn't logging into r/boston to find something that they lost in BROOKLINE.",1

&gt;&gt; This thinking is in line with the conventional wisdom that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000 because of the razor-thin margin between the two major party candidates in Florida. Of course, such logic falls apart when you consider that almost 13 times as many registered Florida Democrats voted for George W. Bush as they did for Nader, and that¬†[liberals-for-Bush exceeded Nader's](https://reason.com/blog/2016/08/03/ralph-nader-did-not-hand-2000-election)¬†total¬†vote by a factor of more than three. [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/)' exit poll posed the hypothetical question of who third party voters would support if the race were only Clinton and Trump, and both Johnson and Stein supporters appeared to support Clinton over Trump by about 25 percent to 15 percent. But 55 percent of Johnson's supporters would have just sat out the election, as would 61 percent of Jill Stein supporters. According to¬†[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html)¬†exit polling, a whopping 63 percent of voters who declined to cast their ballot for the two major party candidates said they would have not voted at all in a two candidate race.

I always found qPCR with fecal-containing samples to be very noisy. There's just a lot of contaminants (I think it was different polysaccharides) at random concentrations that inhibit polymerases at different levels and carried through the nucleic acid extraction with the appropriate kits. Adding in everything else that comes with wastewater (other biologics, total water usage, weather, etc.) and all the factors that can affect viral stability (detergents, pH, temperature, etc.), a single gigantic point may just be a weird outlier, like the one above 100 at the start of September. In this case, also, at the raw data: 

Date|South|North
:--|:--|:--
10/14/2020|103|71
10/16/2020|105|101 
10/18/2020|106|214 
10/19/2020|227|109 

North doubled to 200 and then fell back to 100, followed by South doubling from 100 to 200. 100 is still a concerning level, but it's not the eye-popping three-fold increase of the 60-70 level we were seeing earlier in the month.

I disagree with your point on NAFTA. It's not worth the loss in jobs and onshore manufacturing just to get cheaper prices. Increased productivity doesn't benifit the working class much since wages are now entirely detached from productivity. 


And if Biden is so willing to listen to his allies, why have there been no reports of him floating any progressive in any position in his administration? It's easy to make policy promises you don't plan on keeping, but personel is policy and I would trust his unity commission promises a lot more if there were progressives in his cabinet. He seems far more willing to reach out to neoconservatives than progressives or even trump supporters, unless you think trumpers are a fan of John Kasich and Jeff Flake.

On top of that, his outright refusal to ban fracking is deeply disappointing and I'm not a fan of all the saber rattling with Iran that's been going on.

&gt; A bunch of comparisons to countries I never mentioned is also irrelevant. If full on left is, let‚Äôs say, North Korea, (yes, I know, totalitarianism /= communist, that‚Äôs a different discussion) then let‚Äôs not pretend that a politician pushing for single-payer healthcare is somehow out of mainstream of human society or radical.

my point was that Sanders is pushing for a single payer healthcare system that eliminates private insurance that duplicates government service, covers vision and dental, and is free at the point of use. that *is* a radical proposal. he is not pushing for the single-payer healthcare systems enacted by the countries often cited as their models (namely Scandinavia, Western Europe, and the Anglosphere). single-payer as implemented in the UK or Canada looks *very* different from his specific version of M4A. 

moreover, you did bring up those countries, by virtue of the fact that in your original comment, you stated that ""Biden Is objectively a bit right of center in a global political context. Even Sanders is only slightly left of center from that frame of reference."" a global political frame of reference must include the global spectrum of countries - including conservative countries (and I even discounted, off the bat, any straight theocracies). 

&gt; To dwell on the topic you‚Äôre singling our

I also cited policies on refugees, police brutality, and LGBT rights, but okay. 

&gt;  they find our healthcare system bewildering and demonstrably inferior to the range of circumstances they enjoy in their home countries. [...]  Expecting that the most powerful nation on earth could do a little better is not radical, it‚Äôs common sense. Using an existing program‚Äôs framework as the basis for ‚Äúa little better‚Äù is not radical either, it‚Äôs also common sense‚Ä¶ and dare I say, conservative.

my objections in the first place were not about ""no one should ever reform healthcare in the US,"" they were about Sanders's specific plan to do so. the current system could be improved, nor have I ever disputed that. you yourself acknowledge that there is a range of healthcare that your coworkers have enjoyed in their home countries, and many of those systems enjoy objectively better standards of care, lower tax burden, and are more appealing to the American population. a public option is the universal healthcare system in a huge portion of Europe: Biden would not be center right. banning private insurance and private hospitals would be a radical move well outside the boundaries of most social democracy and labour parties. 

changing healthcare policy =/= M4A. doing better =/= M4A. (also, as any healthcare system change would, in fact, be a huge overhaul, it is definitely not conservative.)",1

"&gt;I don't deny that time and distance are a factor. I *do* deny that the virus is only transmitted if you're within 3 inches of an infected person, which is literally what you said and what you're continuing to stand by.

Try and quote me. I find your hyperbole pretty useless to further this discussion. 

&gt;In addition to time and distance, there is evidence that airborne particles can be moved by HVAC systems in such a way that people become infected. Yes, it's ""just"" three cases, but how many cases are there - with peer-reviewed evidence - of an infected individual visiting a place with an HVAC system, spending some time there, and not infecting others? I'll gladly accept peer-reviewed evidence of this. To my knowledge, none exists. As such, and again, because I have to take a medication that suppresses my immune system, I'm operating with caution.

That means nothing about the virus being infection-capable - this is something that is regularly brought up by the experts who debate this. Which is also why there's only a handful of incidents regarding airborne spread that have been verified. Do I need to bring up the fact that the medical community has been doing nothing but looking at this virus for 9-10 months and they only verified that handful of incidents? I mean I don't know how to tell you this, but the vaccine isn't really going to .. guarantee much of anything. It might cut an already miniscule risk in.. half? You're going to go from being cautious to ... not caring after 50% better odds? If you were cutting certain death in half, I'd see a point. You're cutting 0.0001% in half. I could be off by a factor of 10, but I'd still not see the point of cutting that in half. (If you do the math out.. before your die... which is related to the IFR, you need to get infected... and before that... you need to meet an infectious person... likely ... yes... close up, for a long time). How did you live your life not worrying about ALL of the other diseases... and get so caught up on ONE?


&gt;There are at least a dozen hospitals in Florida with no ICU capacity. Not including the DOZENS with only a couple of beds left. There are entire counties without a single ICU bed available. Were you one of the Republicans eating up that rhetoric about death panels killing Granny a few years ago? Cuz I got news for you. Eventually - they've only fully reopened for a few weeks - they're going to have to triage these patients and decide who lives and dies. I'm not wasting my time looking at GA or TX because you have absolutely zero intentions of taking in any information that threatens your worldview.


Lord have mercy... out of how many hospitals is that? 50? 100? Florida literally re-opened to full capacity and for large events. And that's it? Do you also know that the hospitals run at like 85% ICU capacity as per the norm? And that some patients in there are there out of an overabundance of caution and could be moved out for COVID critical patients, if necessary? Source: random doctors talking about this on the Internet. What's the problem? Where's the wave of death? It's not here. Thankfully. Don't tell me to wait two weeks, either. :)


&gt;Your Sweden claim is patently false. Sweden has the 12th highest per-capita death rate in the world. In fact, Sweden and the US, which has never had broad regulations, make up a unique category of two - the only two nations in the world that have failed to reduce mortality rates over the course of the pandemic. You, or whoever you're getting your information from, is also cherry-picking comparisons - Swedish schools shut down when Massachusetts schools did, for example, even if bars never closed. Sweden's death rate is significantly higher than neighboring countries - a much better comparison than to the US.

Which is pretty impressive, isn't it? They are supposed to be #1 by a factor of TEN? Imperial college predicted 80,000 dead Swedes? Only 6,000 died.

For quick reference. It's old but illustrates that point. 

No lockdown. Minimal restrictions. Think about it. You know what else is interesting? They are slowly dropping out of the top 10.. then top 15... Hmm. So, what good are these lockdowns/masks if without them you still beat places with strict COVID rules? 


&gt;Yep, the virus has a ~3% death rate, much lower than initially feared. It can still completely overwhelm our hospitals if we let it burn through the population.

Pardon? The virus has a death rate for all of 0.13 - 0.25%. If you are quoting 3%, you are stuck in CFR land. The WHO just peer-reviewed a paper from a statistician/biologists's  (John Ioannidis ) that purports the IFR at 0.25%, but claims this is still likely too high. 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8843927/Just-0-05-healthy-70s-Covid-19-die-disease-study-claims.html

My friends, you are so far off base here... even after you said you knew the difference between the IFR and CFR? I guess maybe you meant broadly.. oh well. 

&gt;how are we still locked down???? What is locked down???? Restaurants are open for indoor dining. Bar seating is open. Movie theaters, open, gyms, open, salons, open, indoor skating rinks, open. Like - what are you upset about, exactly???? Our unemployment rate decreased by 4.9% in August alone. With even more restrictions lifted in September and October, we should be making great progress towards economic normalcy. I think we're striking a great balance in this state, keeping our hospitals operating normally while reopening almost everything.

It's getting better, but the ""order food with drinks"" non-sense is silly. At this point I would also say the useless maskarading in those purely voluntary places needs to go. I'm fine with 75% capacity limits, too, just to pacify some people. Transit/bus masking? Hell, grocery store masking? Fine. I've had it with the debbie downer buzzkill of ""mask walking"" to the bathroom at restaurants though. 

So yeah, if Florida can open and things are OK. We can too. Fully. Open. Like they did a full month ago. I'd bet our combined T-cell and B-cell immunity threshold level is probably higher here than in FL because of how hard MA got hit in February (well before March lockdowns). Want to read about that? This is currently.. seemingly being debated (the t-cell immunity part).. but here it is:

&gt;T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in unexposed people; however, the source and clinical relevance of the reactivity remains unknown. It is speculated that this reflects T cell memory to circulating ‚Äòcommon cold‚Äô coronaviruses. It will be important to define specificities of these T cells and assess their association with COVID-19 disease severity and vaccine responses.

"I  haven't seen this posted on the sub yet, it seems like quite a few  people saw/had an interaction with these people recently around Boston Common and Back Bay.

*Full Post Text:*

PSA: Regarding Sexual Assualt, Rape, and Sex Trafficking. If you are a  parent, a young adult, or anyone who has a few minutes. Please read  this.

This is something I debated posting about due to the sensitive nature  but I think its too important not to share and get the word out to as  many people as possible. 

Over the weekend, my 2 friends and I took a day trip to Boston MA.  While everyone was masked up, the parks were still pretty filled up and  everyone seemed to be enjoying the day and going about their own things.  As we were walking through a park, I noticed that these 2 gentlemen (in  the picture) had walked in front of us and start talking to these 2  younger girls (early 20‚Äôs) we had been walking behind for maybe 5  minutes prior. These girls clearly had no idea who these guys were and  the girls definitely were not showing interest in pursuing a  conversation (Guys were asking questions like ‚Äúwhere do you live, etc‚Äù).  Immediately I got a very bad feeling and suggested to my friends that I  intervene, however they suggested we just keep following them and see  what their intentions were. After keeping a distance but keeping an eye  on the 2 girls, we noticed there was a 3rd gentleman also in the same  group who was trailing behind them. Overall just very unnatural  behavior. We waited another 2 minutes until I decided to finally butt in  and try to get these girls out of this clearly awkward and unsettling  situation. I walked up behind the group of 2 girls and yelled out ‚ÄúHey  Jammie, how are you!!!‚Äù. This immediately prompted the guys to walk off.  (Another red flag). You could see the fear in these girl‚Äôs eyes and  they couldn‚Äôt stop thanking my friends and I for looking out for them  and helping them out of the situation. They walked with us until they  felt safe enough to go off on there own again. We thought that would be  the end of our fun. But It wasn‚Äôt. These guys were clearly on a mission.  

We spotted them again, this time, one of the guys targeted a single  young woman who was walking alone. Once again. It was clear she did not  know this man and was not comfortable with the situation. This time, we  didn‚Äôt have a great way to intervene. This guy knew we were following  them and they all knew what we looked like. We continued however to  trail behind them as they walked with this girl. We didn‚Äôt want to lose  sight of them. As time progressed and my friends and I got more uneasy  about the situation, I called the police. I was on the phone with the  operator updating her of the guys (and girl) every movement,street  change ect. All while doing our best to keep a distance. Within 5  minutes we got 2 police cars to our exact location and 4 officers to  assist with the call. They got sight of the gentlemen and set up  officers at each exit of the park to see where they headed to next.  (Corner of Newbury Street). 

Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt know how the situation unfolded from there.  But we informed the officers of everything that occurred over the course  of the hour and did everything we could to make sure these girls were  safe. It was the most unsettling experience I‚Äôve witnessed. I wanted to  write about this to keep the conversation going that things like this  happen. For all we know, these guys could‚Äôve killed those young girls.  Who knows what could‚Äôve happened. The important thing is that if you see  something, please say something. You might just save someone‚Äôs life in  the process. The movies we see regarding sex trafficking and things like  that might not be as far fetched as some people think. The first 2  girls we helped out were from New York. They clearly had no idea how to  leave the situation they were in. They were in a public park, with many  people around. This can happen anywhere. So be aware of your  surroundings. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask someone to come with you to an  unknown place. We need to stick together to keep each other safe. What  we witnessed that day was what felt like pure evil. And I hope those  guys get what they deserve. Thank you to the Boston Police Dept. for the  incredible response time and for taking our call as seriously as we  did. You may have saved a life.",1

"People enter LTC facilities to rehabilitate from a procedure until they're self sufficient again.

People in LTC facilities aren't happy because they're people who were recently healthy enough to be independent, and are desperate to recover and get back to their normal lives.

They're 60 year olds who had a hip replacement that got infected during surgery and need time to heal. Or a 45 year olds who had throat surgery and are building their strength back up to get medically cleared to fly back home.

There's typically an older population at LTC's as they need more time to recover from operations, but they're not invalids, they're not in hospice, they're trying to heal and go home.

Charlestown, Beacon Hill and the North End are also incredibly enjoyable to walk around for the architecture, I even sometimes follow the Freedom Trail just for the fun of it.

As for views oriented, Deer Island has incredible views of Boston, the harbor islands, the ocean, Winthrop and Logan. Revere Beach is also good for plane spotting and waterfront views, as is the waterfront in Lynn and Swampscott. 

The Fells are great if you want to be in a forest, and also gives plenty of good views! Best trails include the Rock Circuit Trail, Skyline Trail and Reservoir Trail. Horn Pond in Woburn is also nice and can give you a good view of Boston from the top of the ""mountain.""

Finally there's the Blue Hills and Castle Island, but I'll admit I haven't been to either since I was 11 so I can't comment on them now.",1

Way back when those buildings were built the streets were full of street cars and people walked from the cars to the stores and then to home. At the time they were called taxpayers because the assumption was they were temporary and would eventually be replaced with multi stories. After automobiles came to dominate the landscape nobody wanted to build Multi story buildings because they would bring more competition for parking spaces and the shops need the spaces for their customers. The guy who does the city beautiful YouTube channel made this point about strip malls. I think he‚Äôs right and it applies to the older streetcar line shops as well. It doesn‚Äôt make me furious; what I like about it is that it makes greater Boston a walking environment. Without too many exceptions our streets are lined with houses and shops instead of lined with parking lots.,1

Unfortunately, hospital beds are almost entirely used up: https://www.kxnet.com/news/local-news/north-dakota-hospitals-are-nearing-capacity-for-icu-beds/

More nurses could help unlock some unstaffed hospital beds in the state. But when so few people are taking the precaution of wearing masks, and 250 people weddings are still happening, it has to be frustrating.

It is completely against what the experts are telling him needs to be done and what they‚Äôve been telling him through the summer as well. It‚Äôs always been 4 things. Stop indoor dining, shift all schools to online, and reduce gatherings to 10 or less, and stop other avenues where people can gather indoors and be in close proximities for long periods of time (movie theaters, sports, gyms, etc).

With those measures in place, there‚Äôs an astronomically low chance of covid getting out of hand in our state but he‚Äôs content with how many are getting sick right now and not willing to make the tough calls that would force some of the more inconsiderate to reel it in so everyone can stay safe.

"His record is about as mixed as Biden's, but with some good environmental victories under his belt. Though when has that ever stopped a dem from winning in Massachusetts? To be clear, Markey has proven to be a strong progressive, even given his mixed voting record. My reason for believing that is that Markey was trailing Kennedy by 15 points at the start of this. No Kennedy had ever lost in Massachusetts. People thought it was a forgone conclusion that Kennedy would beat Markey badly and that he should simply step down to avoid embarrassment. Sunrise were a major player in Markey's campaign and they've been transformative in many campaigns around the country. Jamal Bowman said that of the 1.2 million phone calls made by his campaign, over 800k were by Sunrise. And considering Markey is one of Sunrise's two champions, they were gunning hard for him.

"Essential what it would allow is you or your mechanic to access your vehicle sensors wirelessly. So currently you need a scan tool. The cheap ones can pull ""Code"" which tells you a general error. (Like $20)

P0301 is a misfire on cylinder 1. Now that is very general. That can be caused by a bad sparkplug, a bad ignition coil, low fuel pressure, faulty wires, a bad crank sensor, etc. Etc. 

Now an midrange or expensive tool $200-$5000 tool can read the direct sensor data. So you can see that cylinder one is not getting proper fuel pressure, so more than likely that would be a fuel injector. 

You would now be able to do that with an official phone app. One that manufactures can't lock that data out of. Which they like to do from time to time. 

The official diagnostic computers are dealer only. So every few years the makers of the third party tools have to reverse engineer the software on the car to make the tool usable on that car. That makes them expensive. 

On some cars a simple task like replacing a brake caliper(A hydraulic clamp that squeezes the brake pads onto a rotor to stop you.) You have to plug in a diagnostic computer to bleed the lines after. (Air can compress so in a hydraulic system that's not good.)

The fear is also that now that cars can be updated remotely, the manufacturer can lock out the third party tools from looking at sensor data when ever they want.",1

"One Massachusetts State Police captain, alcohol on his breath and an open beer bottle rattling around his unmarked cruiser, led Saugus police on a chase and had to be wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.

All of these troopers are on patrol today, having escaped termination from the state‚Äôs largest law enforcement agency despite crimes or serious misconduct.

A Globe review of the department‚Äôs internal affairs files shows the agency rarely fires troopers almost no matter what they have done. The Globe found only a handful of examples of firings in the last decade.

Meanwhile, dozens of troopers found by internal investigators to have broken the law remain on the force today. They collectively have 29 sustained charges for assault and battery; 19 alcohol and drug violations, including four OUIs; 17 charges for harassment, including three for sexual harassment; another 17 for improperly using the state‚Äôs criminal background check system.

Another trooper was caught providing unauthorized police escorts for funeral processions and taking cash under the table, while also routinely skipping portions of detail and overtime shifts for which he was paid.

And then there is the trooper duo ‚Äî academy classmates and close friends ‚Äî who regularly hung out with known criminals. One trooper traveled and partied in Las Vegas with people tied to organized crime, coming under federal scrutiny after he admitted he improperly ran background checks on behalf of drug dealers linked to an illegal gambling operation.",1

"Honeypot is the best of the best tbh. I make a couple trips each fall just for those donuts. I don‚Äôt really bother with the apple picking, but if you go on a weekday there‚Äôs no lines for the baked goods.",1
I can second this. Beautiful hill top location with some nice views.,1
KN95 is not N95,1
"Aw, here's a sight I haven't seen in a while üíõ",1
On the bright side he didn‚Äôt have to experience 2020,1
Silver  linings I guess...... I  looked at his last few posts earlier and they were asking about hospitals.....kinda spooky.,1
Why is Copley Station always causing issues?,1
Went there all the time as a kid. Great place.,1
wicked,1
"I've been going to this farm for the past 11 years, only once interrupted.

I've never gone this late. Are there still lots of apples? I could eat a half dozen sugar donuts myself in the ride home.",1
"I think Is'Original tastes better with stronger and more complex flavors. They will also make it very very spicy if you ask them to. I crave it often and haven't had a bad dish from there. 

Rod D by Sitti is good but a little more bland and feels like it is made in a way to be inoffensive to people new to thai food. I've also asked them to make it ""spicy level 20 thai spicy"" and it is barely warm. It felt like they are use to a customer base who doesn't want heat.",1
"My family wants me to fly home but I don't want to kill my 80 year old grandma as I work around the general public full time. 

I don't blame them rejecting the reality of the situation as it is sad.",1
"Athens Pizza in South Leominster would be the one to go to. The general consensus among the residents is that the South Leominster location is significantly better than the North Leominster location by the train.

And to bump on the food recommendations. If you get off the T during diner hours, North End Diner is right there as well.",1
"""Comedy"".",1
Time to shut the state down again. Fuck Baker.,1
"That's dope, went there today, really should have gotten a hug of that hard cider I wonder how they do with it.",1
"As it stands I'm not going to be attending the usual family Thanksgiving or Christmas because it's going to be indoors and they won't be wearing masks at all. It'd be on the table if they wore masks in any capacity, but they don't even believe the pandemic is real, so that's not going to happen. Oh well.",1
"Honey Pot Hill in Stow has awesome cider donuts, I‚Äôve tried many from other places and they‚Äôre not as good. The hayride is at least 20 minutes and showed me how big the place is. There‚Äôs a small animal feeding area too.",1
"This is the closest I‚Äôve ever been, too fancy for my liking.",1
"Where is this, Revere?",1
OP did you take this video?,1
What? Why? You‚Äôre supposed to fill those out neatly and fully. Not 80 percent,1
"Oh my god, now I want Cider donuts. What have you done to me?",1
No.,1
I wish I could upvote this more than once. That's awesome!,1
A good boy,1
"It‚Äôs interesting that all the hand ringing is about one of the lowest positive rate neighborhoods (Southie is 3.5%), while no one is talking about cracking down on the rolling block parties in and around Franklin Park and the extremely high positive rates for the neighborhoods it‚Äôs revelers hail from.",1
Whoa does this happen frequently?,1
Title?,1
"There is a guy swimming in the picture. Does anyone know what happens if your kite goes down out in the water, is the only option to swim to shore to dry/fly the kite again?",1
"See this a lot. People say ""oh, i'll get it on my way out"" and then don't. In fact I saw a friend of mine do this until we stared at him to pick it up. So so frustrating in nice but heavily used places like the Fells.",1
It‚Äôs for the garbage guy to pick up maybe,1
Are you being sarcastic?,1
"Blue Hills suffers from this. If you aren‚Äôt going to pick it up, take a stick and knuckle puck it into the woods off the path. If you already bagged, carry it with you. You already felt the heat of that fresh loaf and a big whiff.",1
"The Alley is open last I checked, they were able to get the kitchen going.",1
bravo,1
Just let Jesus take the wheel and you‚Äôll be all set. Also remember which way to turn your wheel when parking under certain circumstances!,1
You're suggesting to throw the bag deeper into the woods?,1
"If the kite is intact and the lines are not tangled , it‚Äôs very easy to relaunch it from the water. It doesn‚Äôt need to be dried out. Usually the beginners have to swim until they get the skills.",1
"No. If someone is choosing to be a bum and not pick up their dogs feces, then the very least they could do is use something to move it off the trail.

If you already bagged, take it with you and throw it out. There‚Äôs no point to leave bagged poop behind. People that bag their dog‚Äôs feces and then leave it on the trail, are morons. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a lot of people like that here.",1
No psychedelics on the drug question?,1
"No! Instead of just not bothering and leaving it out to the elements to dry out in the sun and wash away in the rain, it‚Äôs best to half-do the job and wrap it in a plastic sarcophagus that will protect it for weeks and weeks until someone else comes and picks it up for you.",1
"if only there were more providers, i tried to get a referral and passed the phone screener only to be told there are no available specialists at all under my insurance, not oh theyre making appointments months in advance just there is no one for you. they sent me a list of outside options but thats a lot to navigate and its just frustrating to have to pay out of insurance when i have the mental health insurance just no one in network.

imagine breaking a bone and just being told sorry theres no doctors",1
"Yes that‚Äôs a huge issue. My insurance happens to cover weekly therapy appointments permanently. I only go every other week now, but I definitely couldn‚Äôt afford it otherwise.",1
the formality of wrapping it in plastic before placing it back on the ground is so baffling lmao just say you like touching shit and go,1
Bring donuts.,1
Also pleasure bay is a bit more difficult to relaunch because there‚Äôs not much wind close to the water with the causeway blocking it,1
"It's probably the same people who whine about wearing a mask.  There's a term that people use in Europe that never caught on in the US, ""asocial"", for someone who is indifferent or hostile to the needs of living in a society.  We basically have an entire political party based on asociality.",1
It‚Äôs not a consequence because he‚Äôs assumed innocent until proven guilty.,1
I knew you were one of those idiots. I could smell it on you.,1
That seems to be a touchy subject. [but it has come up before](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/im2voe/group_wants_officials_to_help_stop_a_second/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).,1
"You have to head to the far back left, but there are still plenty left. The macintosh and Spencer's were the best",1
School st Field in Acton. It‚Äôs accessible from Rt 2 East. I‚Äôve seen model rockets shot off from there.,1
"That's antisocial here in the US. Asocial just means someone doesn't like the company of others, but isn't misanthropic.",1
This guy is a CLOWN. You CANNOT POLICE WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THEIR HOMES.,1
So Carson beach?,1
Salty,1
I love it.  Chinatown holds a special place in my heart.,1
